Hard links
 - different directory entry pointing the same inode
 - only within file system. why?
 - link count maintained in inode

Soft links
 - links are represented as files with the path
 - different inodes
 - symbolic link can be broken. meaning the target file can be deleted without symbolic link update
 - across file systems.
