Daughter's ages
Two MIT math grads bump into each other at Fairway on the upper west side. they haven't seen each other in over 20 years. 
the first grad says to the second: "how have you been?"second: "great! i got married and i have three daughters now"first: "really? how old are they?"second: "well, the product of their ages is 72, and the sum of their ages is the same as the number on that building over there.."first: "right, ok.. oh wait.. hmm, i still don't know"second: "oh sorry, the oldest one just started to play the piano"first: "wonderful! my oldest is the same age!" 
problem: how old are the daughters? 
Solution: daughter's ages
two MIT math grads bump into each other at Fairway on the upper west side. they haven't seen each other in over 20 years. 
the first grad says to the second: "how have you been?"second: "great! i got married and i have three daughters now"first: "really? how old are they?"second: "well, the product of their ages is 72, and the sum of their ages is the same as the number on that building over there.."first: "right, ok.. oh wait.. hmm, i still don't know"second: "oh sorry, the oldest one just started to play the piano"first: "wonderful! my oldest is the same age!" 
problem: how old are the daughters? 
solution: start with what you know. you know there are 3 daughters whose ages multiply to 72. let's look at the possibilities... 
Ages:            Sum of ages:1 1 72            741 2 36            391 3 24            281 4 18            231 6 12            191 8 9             182 2 18            222 3 12            172 4 9             152 6 6             143 3 8             143 4 6             13
after looking at the building number the man still can't figure out what their ages are (we're assuming since he's an MIT math grad, he can factor 72 and add up the sums), so the building number must be 14, since that is the only sum that has more than one possibility. 
finally the man discovers that there is an oldest daughter. that rules out the "2 6 6" possibility since the two oldest would be twins. therefore, the daughters ages must be "3 3 8". (caveat: an astute reader pointed out that it is possible for two siblings to have the same age but not be twins, for instance one is born in january, and the next is conceived right away and delivered in october. next october both siblings will be one year old. if a candidate points this out, extra credit points to him/her.) This question is pretty neat, although there is certainly a bit of an aha factor to it. the clues are given in such a way that you think you are missing information (the building number), but whats important isn't the building number, but the fact that the first man thought that it was enough information, but actually wasn't. Even if the candidate doesn't know the solution, they could come up with some interesting thoughts. if they just stare at you and shrug "i dunno" then thank them for their time and don't give them a fogcreek pen. 
Palindromes
problem: this year on October 2, 2001, the date in MMDDYYYY format will be a palindrome (same forwards as backwards).10/02/2001when was the last date that this occurred on? (see if you can do it in your head!)

Solution: palindrome
problem: this year on October 2, 2001, the date in MMDDYYYY format will be a palindrome (same forwards as backwards).10/02/2001when was the last date that this occurred on? (see if you can do it in your head!) 
solution: we know the year has to be less than 2001 since we already have the palindrome for 10/02. it can't be any year in 1900 because that would result in a day of 91. same for 1800 down to 1400. it could be a year in 1300 because that would be the 31st day. so whats the latest year in 1300 that would make a month? at first i thought it would be 1321, since that would give us the 12th month, but we have to remember that we want the maximum year in the 1300 century with a valid month, which would actually be 1390, since 09/31 is a valid date. 
but of course, a question like this wouldn't be complete without an aha factor. and of course, there are not 31 days in september, only 30. so we have to go back to august 08 which means the correct date would be 08/31/1380. 
palindromes also offer another great string question.write a function that tests for palindromesbool isPalindrome( char* pStr ) 
if you start a pointer at the beginning and the end of the string and keep comparing characters while moving the pointers closer together, you can test if the string is the same forwards and backwards. notice that the pointers only have to travel to the middle, not all the way to the other end (to reduce redundancy). 
bool isPalindrome( char* pStr ){  if ( pStr == NULL )   return false;   char* pEnd = pStr;  while ( *pEnd != '\0' )    pEnd++;   pEnd--;   while(pEnd > pStr)  {    if ( *pEnd != *pStr )      return false;     pEnd--;    pStr++;  }   return true;}




Sum it up 
problem: you are given a sequence of numbers from 1 to n-1 with one of the numbers repeating only once. (example: 1 2 3 3 4 5). how can you find the repeating number? what if i give you the constraint that you can't use a dynamic amount of memory (i.e. the amount of memory you use can't be related to n)? what if there are two repeating numbers (and the same memory constraint?) 
Solution: sum it up'
problem: you are given a sequence of numbers from 1 to n-1 with one of the numbers repeating once. (example: 1 2 3 3 4 5) how can you find the repeating number? 
solution: 
as a programmer, my first answer to this problem would be. since there were no constraints in the question, this is an ok answer. its good because it makes sense if you draw it for someone, whether they are a programmer, mathemetician, or just your grandpa. its not the most efficient answer though. 



Solution: pirates
Five pirates have 100 gold coins. they have to divide up the loot. in order of seniority (suppose pirate 5 is most senior, pirate 1 is least senior), the most senior pirate proposes a distribution of the loot. they vote and if at least 50% accept the proposal, the loot is divided as proposed. otherwise the most senior pirate is executed, and they start over again with the next senior pirate. what solution does the most senior pirate propose? assume they are very intelligent and extremely greedy (and that they would prefer not to die). 
(to be clear on what 50% means, 3 pirates must vote for the proposal when there are 5 for it to pass. 2 if there are 4. 2 if there are 3. etc... ) 
solution: most of the time i get people who give answers like "the most senior pirate takes half and divides the rest up among the least senior pirates." um, you missed the whole point to begin with. sorry. 
any answer without a specific logic behind it is invalid. if i ask you why pirate 5 gave x coins to pirate 1, please don't say "because he's nice". 
now for the real solution. pirate 5 being the most senior knows that he needs to get 2 other people to vote for his solution in order for him not to be executed. so who can he get to vote for him, and why would they choose to vote for him? if you start thinking that pirate 4 will never vote for him, because he would rather have 5 die and then be in charge and take it all for himself, you are on the right track. but it gets more complicated. 
. 
if there were 3 pirates, pirate 3 has to convince at least one other person to join in his plan. so who can he convince and how? here is the leap that needs to be made to solve this problem. pirate 3 realizes that if his plan is not adopted he will be executed and they will be left with 2 pirates. 
so lets sum up at this point 
Pirate 1  2  3  4  5    5. ?  ?  ?  ?  ?    4. 0  1  0 99  -    3. 1  0 99  -  -    2. 0 100 -  -  -    1.100
once you see the pattern it becomes very clear. you have to realize that when a pirate's plan does not succeed then that means you are in the same situation with one less pirate.1. pirate 1 needs 0 other people to vote for him. so he votes for himself and takes all the money. 2. pirate 2 needs 0 other people to vote for him. so he votes for himself and takes all the money. pirate 1 gets 0. 3. pirate 3 needs 1 other person to vote for him. he gives 1 coin to pirate 1 for his vote - if we are reduced to 2 pirates, pirate 1 gets 0 so pirate 1 knows 1 is better than none. pirate 3 takes 99. pirate 2 gets 0. 4. pirate 4 needs 1 other person to vote for him. he gives 1 coin to pirate 2 - if we reduce to 3 pirates, pirate 2 gets 0 so pirate 2 knows 1 is better than none. pirate 4 takes 99. pirate 3 gets 0. pirate 1 gets 0. 5. pirate 5 needs 2 other people to vote for him. its clear now that the 2 people he needs to convince are the 2 who get shafted in the 4 pirate scenario - pirate 3 and pirate 1. so he can give them each 1 coin (which is better than 0 - what they would get otherwise) and keep 98 for himself. 
Pirate 1  2  3  4  5    5. 1  0  1  0 98
what happens if there are 15 pirates? pirate 15 needs 7 other people to vote for him, so he recruits pirates 13,11,9,7,5,3, and 1 with 1 coin each and keeps 93 coins himself. those pirates will all vote for him because they know that they get 0 coins if he dies and pirate 14 is in charge. 
Fogcreek programmers
100 fogcreek programmers are lined up in a row by an assassin. the assassin puts red and blue hats on them. they can't see their own hats, but they can see the hats of the people in front of them. the assassin starts in the back and says "what color is your hat?" the fogcreek programmer can only answer "red" or "blue." the programmer is killed if he gives the wrong answer; then the assassin moves on to the next programmer. the programmers in front get to hear the answers of the programmers behind them, but not whether they live or die. they can consult and agree on a strategy before being lined up, but after being lined up and having the hats put on, they can't communicate in any way other than those already specified. what strategy should they choose to maximize the number of programmers who are guaranteed to be saved? 
Solution: fog creek programmers

this is a very difficult problem to solve during an interview (especially if you've already taxed the candidate's brain). look for obvious solutions first, and the reasoning behind them and then try to lead them to the ultimate solution. 
a logical answer could be all the programmers would just say "red" and that way about half of them would survive on average, assuming the hats were distributed randomly. 
this is a good start and should naturally lead to having every other programmer say the color of the hat in front of them. the first programmer would say the color of the hat in front of him, then the next programmer would just say that color that was just said. so we can guarantee that half survive - the even numbered programmers (since the person behind them told them the answer). and potentially if the hats were distributed randomly some of the programmers would get lucky and the hat in front of them would be the same color as their own. so this strategy should save more than half, and on average 75% of them would live. 
at this point, if the solution is not clear, the candidate may give answers like, "they could agree that if they said their hat color in a soft voice, it means the hat in front of them is the same color, and if they say it in a loud voice, it means the hat in front is a different color". this is definitely good and on the correct track. another option is they could say "reeeeeeeeeeed" for x number of seconds, where x represented the distribution of hats where a hat was a bit in a binary number, (red = 1, blue = 0). another interesting answer. there are many others like these that "bend" the rules and come to a solution. 
but the real solution acknowledges that the programmers can only say "red" or "blue" and cannot alter their voice in such a convincing way as to signal any information other than the word they said. a good way to get this point across, is simply to change the problem slightly by saying "the assassin gets to hear their plan before she puts the hats on, and so will try to thwart the plan however she can." 
so if they decide to all say "red", she'll put blue hats on all of them. if they decide to all say the color of the hat in front of them, she'll alternate the hats on every head, guaranteeing half will die. even with the assassin hearing their plan, there is still a way to save almost everyone. 
we know that the first person is never going to have any information about the color of their hat, so they cannot be guaranteed to survive. but, i'll give you a hint to the solution: i can save every other person for sure. 
solution: they agree that if the number of red hats that the back person can see is even, that programmer will say "red". if they add up to an odd number, they will say "blue". this way number 99 can look ahead and count the red hats. if they add up to an even number and number 100 said "red", then 99 must be wearing a blue hat. if they add up to an even number and number 100 said "blue", signalling an odd number of red hats, number 99 must also be wearing a red hat. number 98 knows that 99 said the correct hat, and so uses that information along with the 97 hats in front to figure out what color hat is on 98's head. 
sample: 
100  99  98  97  96  95  94 ... facing -> R    B   B   R   B   R   B ... -> 45 R and 48 B
this shows #100 wearing a red hat, 99 a blue, 98 a blue, 97 a red, 96 a blue, 95 a red, 94 a blue and 45 red hats - 48 blue hats on the people in front of them. 
100 counts up the red hats: 47 total. so 100 says "blue". the assassin kills 100. 99 counts up the red hats in front: 47. 100 said blue, so 100 saw an odd number. 99 sees an odd number, so 99 says "blue" and lives. 98 had counted 47 red hats, and 99 didn't say "red" so thats still the total. 98 says "blue". 97 counts up and finds 46 red hats. 99 and 98 didn't say "red", so his count is missing a red hat (its on his head, he realizes). he says "red". 96 heard the "red" and now knows that there are an even number of "red" hats in front of 95. 96 sees 46, so he knows he has a "blue" hat. etc... 
even if the assassin knows the plan, she can't thwart it. she hears the plan, but she still has to put the hats on their heads. the plan doesn't rely on any ordering of the hats, so the worst the assassin can do is to make sure #100 gets killed and thats the worst damage she can do.


Bad king  aha:!
a bad king has a cellar of 1000 bottles of delightful and very expensive wine. a neighbouring queen plots to kill the bad king and sends a servant to poison the wine. (un)fortunately the bad king's guards catch the servant after he has only poisoned one bottle. alas, the guards don't know which bottle but know that the poison is so strong that even if diluted 1,000,000 times it would still kill the king. furthermore, it takes one month to have an effect. the bad king decides he will get some of the prisoners in his vast dungeons to drink the wine. being a clever bad king he knows he needs to murder no more than 10 prisoners - believing he can fob off such a low death rate - and will still be able to drink the rest of the wine at his anniversary party in 5 weeks time. 
explain how.... 
Solution: bad king

(un)fortunately the bad king's guards catch the servant after he has only poisoned one bottle. alas, the guards don't know which bottle but know that the poison is so strong that even if diluted 1,000,000 times it would still kill the king. furthermore, it takes one month to have an effect. the bad king decides he will get some of the prisoners in his vast dungeons to drink the wine. being a clever bad king he knows he needs to murder no more than 10 prisoners - believing he can fob off such a low death rate - and will still be able to drink the rest of the wine at his anniversary party in 5 weeks time. 
explain how... 
solution: i'll give you a hint. 1000 is less than 1024. if there were 1024 or more bottles of wine it would take more than 10 prisoners. 
number the bottles 1 to 1000, and write the number in binary format.
bottle 1    = 0000000001bottle 250  = 0011111010bottle 1000 = 1111101000
now take your prisoner's 1 through 10 and let prisoner 1 take a sip from every bottle that has a 1 in its least significant bit. let prisoner 10 take a sip from every bottle with a 1 in its most significant bit. etc. 
prisoner    10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1bottle 924   1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
for instance, bottle #924 would be sipped by 10,9,8,5,4 and 3. that way if bottle #924 was the poisoned one, only those prisoners would die. 
after four weeks, line the prisoners up in their bit order and read each living prisoner as a 0 bit and each dead prisoner as a 1 bit. the number that you get is the bottle of wine that was poisoned. 
additional question: to increase your chance of living, which prisoner would you want to be? 
if there were 1023 bottles, it wouldn't matter since everyone would have to take 512 sips. but there are 23 bottles less, so the people whose bits would have been on from 1001 to 1023 won't have to take a sip. 1001 is [11111 01001] in binary and 1023 is [11111 11111]. the most five significant bits are the most interesting because they would always be on from 1001 to 1023, so all those people are missing out on 23 bottles of wine that they otherwise would have had to drink. so in order to increase your chance of living, you'd probably want to be prisoner 6 to 10. (but depending on how the king determines who is least significant and who is most significant you could get shafted.) 
note that if the king was really trying to kill the least number of prisoners, he should have let 999 prisoners each take a sip from their respective bottle numerically (if he had that many prisoners at his disposal). that way only one prisoner would die, and there's a chance of 1/1000 that no one would die, but then the puzzle isn't very fun.


Jelly beans
you have three jars that are all mislabeled. one contains peanut butter jelly beans, another grape jelly jelly beans, and the third has a mix of both (not necessarily a 50/50 mix, could be a 1/99 mix or a 399/22 mix). how many jelly beans would you have to pull out, and out of which jars, to find out how to fix the labels on the jars? 
|     |        |     |          |     ||jar 1|        |jar 2|          |jar 3||     |        |     |          |     |=======        =======          =======  p.b.          grape          p.b./grape
Solution: jellybeans
you have three jars that are all mislabeled. one contains peanut butter jelly beans, another grape jelly jelly beans, and the third has a mix of both (not necessarily a 50/50 mix, could be a 1/99 mix or a 399/22 mix). how many jelly beans would you have to pull out, and out of which jars, to find out how to fix the labels on the jars? 
|     |        |     |          |     ||jar 1|        |jar 2|          |jar 3||     |        |     |          |     |=======        =======          =======  p.b.          grape          p.b./grape
solution: 1 jelly bean from the p.b./grape jar will do the trick. 
the trick here is to realize that every jar is mislabeled. therefore you know that the peanut butter jelly bean jar is not the penut butter jelly bean jar, and the same goes for the rest. 
you also need to realize that it is the jar labeled p.b./grape, labelled as the mix jar, that is your best hope. if you choose a jelly bean out of there, then you will know whether that jar is peanut butter or grape jelly jelly beans. it can't be the mix jar because i already said that every jar is mislabeled. 
once you know that jar 3 is either peanut butter, or grape jelly, then you know the other jars also. if it is peanut butter, then jar 2 must be mixed because it can't be grape (as its labelled) and it can't be peanut butter (that's jar 3). hence jar 1 is grape. 
if jar 3 is grape, then you know jar 1 must be the mix because it can't be p.b. (as its labelled) and it can't be grape (that's jar 3). hence jar 2 is peanut butter. 
if you pick jelly beans from jar 1 or jar 2, then you would have to pick out all of the jelly beans before you knew what that jar was. this is because jar 1 and 2 could be the mix, so in order to disprove that they were the mix, you would have to pull out every jelly bean just to make sure (since there could just be one bean of the opposite flavor in there). 


Bridge
problem: this one is a classic that many of you have probably already heard, but all the more reason why it should definitely be included here. four people are on this side of the bridge. the bridge will be destroyed by a bomb in 17 minutes. everyone has to get across before that. problem is that it's dark and so you can't cross the bridge without a flashlight, and they only have one flashlight. plus the bridge is only big enough for two people to cross at once. the four people walk at different speeds: one fella is so fast it only takes him 1 minute to cross the bridge, another 2 minutes, a third 5 minutes, the last it takes 10 minutes to cross the bridge. when two people cross the bridge together (sharing the flashlight), they both walk at the slower person's pace. can they all get across before the bridge blows up?

person A: 1 minuteperson B: 2 minutesperson C: 5 minutesperson D:10 minutes
solution: of course its possible, otherwise it wouldn't be a very interesting question. the only trick is in realizing that you want to get the two slowest people across together, because otherwise you are wasting too much time. but then once you get them across, how do you not make one of them walk back with the flashlight? well, you just have one of the fast people already there waiting to sprint the flashlight back across.

another solution which is valid is to have A bring the flashlight back in step 2. it only changes the solution slightly. this is supposed to be a "classic" microsoft interview question but it seems absurdly easy to be a good interview question (especially coupled with the fact that everyone has probably heard it already).



Card trick without the trick
this is a card trick without the trick. there is no sleight of hand, no tricks up my sleeve, no magic whatsoever. it's all done with logic, yet it will amaze most people. 
joel and i are working together as a team to do the trick. babak will be the culprit. 
i ask babak to pick 5 cards out of a deck. he can pick any five cards, he can shuffle the deck 7 times, it really doesn't matter. he honestly picks out 5 cards that i cannot see. he hands the five cards to me (joel can't see any of this). i look at the cards and i pick 1 card out and give it back to babak. i then arrange the other four cards in a special way, and give those 4 cards all face down, and in a neat pile, to joel. joel looks at the 4 cards i gave him, and says out loud which card babak is holding (suit and number). 
i did not convey any information to joel other than the way i ordered the 4 cards, (all face down, aligned in line with one another) so how did i encode babak's card using that method?
Hint 1: with five cards there will always be at least two cards of the same suit. since i get to pick the card to give back to babak, i can use that to my advantage to communicate the suit to joel.
Hint 2: if i communicate the suit to joel with one of the cards, then i'm only left with the other 3 cards to show the number. since only the ordering of the cards can be used, i am allowed up to six combinations. well, that won't do to signify up to 13 cards, will it? certainly not, but if i pick the right card to show the suit, i can use that card to reduce the range of cards down to 6. how?

Solution: hint 1 talks about how there are guaranteed to be at least 2 cards with the same suit in a series of five cards. i use this to signal to joel the suit of the card. i have to make a decision though between which of the two cards to give back to babak. which one do i pick? 
hint 2 talks about how if i use one of the cards to signal the suit, that only leaves me with 3 cards. i can only arrange 3 cards in six permutations. how do i signal a number between 2 and 13 using only six permutations? 
simple really. consider that the series of cards is a cycle.
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 ... etc
i take the two cards of the same suit (if there are more than two of the same suit, then i choose any two, it won't affect the solution) and i pass babak the one that is further to the right in the cycle. if i do it correctly, the one further to the right will be no more than 6 places away than the one to the left. (it just depends on how you think about the cycle). 
for example. say we had the 2 and the 9 of hearts. if you look at it as the 2 to the left and the 9 to the right, it is seven cards away. but if you look as the 9 to the left and the 2 to the right in the cycle, the 2 is only 6 cards away. 
then i just come up with a system of the permutations that signals how many places to the right to count to find the correct card 
one such system could be:sort the 3 non-same suit cards first by number then by suit (diamonds, spades, hearts, clubs) to give a unique sort for every card.label the cards as A, B, and C.place the cards in the following order to signal how many places away babak's card is:
A B C - 1A C B - 2B A C - 3B C A - 4C A B - 5C B A - 6
then put the suit card on top and give the pile to joel. 
example:babak picks out the following five cards:
3C 7D 10S QH AD
the 7 of diamonds (7D) and the ace of diamonds (AD) are the two suit cards. i recognize that AD is going to be the left card and 7D the right (because the other way they are 7 spaces apart). i give babak back the 7D. i sort the other cards, 3C 10S QH. i have to signal 6 places to the right (7D - AD = 6). so i place them in C B A format: QH 10S 3C. i then place the AD on top and pass to joel. 
joel pulls off the first card and sees that it is the AD. (he knows babak's card is a diamond). he looks at the next 3 cards and realizes their ordering is C B A. signalling 6, he counts 6 spots from the ace. (2 3 4 5 6 7). then he says "7 of diamonds" and the crowd is amazed. 
another sneakier card trick (with the trick) works as follows. 
babak picks one card out of the deck and shows it to me. he doesn't tell joel and i don't speak. after seeing the card, i sneakily use my one hand to signal both the number and suit of the card. i use my four fingers (not the thumb) as bits signalling a binary number. if they are extended it means 1, if i don't extend them it means 0. the pinky is the least significant. so to signal 7 i would extend all fingers except my index finger. the suit is signalled by four positions of the thumb (hidden, adjacent to the hand, slightly ajar, fully extended). i can use this method to tell joel the card without saying anything (and making any noticeable motions). with some practice it can really amaze people (at least it worked with my family). 


Pirates revisited
a slightly different version of the original pirates problem (read that one first to get all the rules). 6 pirates, only one gold coin. as before, the pirates are super-smart, and they value, in this order: (i) their lives, (ii) getting money, (iii) seeing other pirates die. so if given the choice between two outcomes, in which they get the same amount of money, they'd choose the outcome where they get to see more of the other pirates die. how can pirate 6 save his skin?

3 pirate case: pirate 3 has to give the coin to pirate 1, because if he gives it pirate 2 pirate 2 will say "screw that i wanna see you die and i'm going to get the coin anyway." so in 3 pirate case, we have pirate 1 gets 1 coin, pirates 2 and 3 get 0.
4 pirate case: pirate 4 can't give the coin to pirate 1, because pirate 1 would rather see him die since he's going to get 1 coin anyway. But pirate 4 could give the coin to either pirate 2 or pirate 3. 
5 pirate case: pirate 5 just dies, and it goes to the 4 pirate case. there is no way for him to convince two people to vote for him. 
6 pirate case: pirate 6 can count on his own vote, plus pirate 5's vote, because 5 won't want to die. now who should he give the coin to? he could give it to pirate 1 or to pirate 4, since in the 4 pirate case they are guaranteed to get nothing. it's unclear whether he could give it to pirate 2 or 3. neither pirate 2 nor pirate 3 is guaranteed to get a coin in the 4 pirate case. so the question is, how do they value (i) definitely getting a coin from pirate 6 vs. (ii) definitely seeing pirates 6 and 5 die, with the chance of getting a coin from pirate 4. since we don't have enough information to answer that, to be safe, i would just say pirate 6 should offer the coin to pirate 1 or pirate 4. 


Fuse on fire
a mad bomber is out on the job, making bombs. he has two fuses (pieces of string) of varying thickness which each burn for 30 seconds. unfortunately he wants this bomb to go off in 45 seconds. he can't cut the one fuse in half because the fuses are different thicknesses and he can't be sure how long it will burn. how can he arrange the fuses to make his bomb go off at the right time?
Solution: fuse on fire
problem: a mad bomber is out on the job, making bombs. he has two fuses (pieces of string) of varying thickness which each burn for 30 seconds. unfortunately he wants this bomb to go off in 45 seconds. he can't cut the one fuse in half because the fuses are different thicknesses and he can't be sure how long it will burn. (for example: the first half of the fuse might burn up in 10 seconds and the second half in 20 seconds.. the fuse doesn't burn at a constant rate, but the total time it would burn is 30 seconds). how can he arrange the fuses to make his bomb go off at the right time? 
solution: light both ends of one of the fuses. when that fuse goes out, 15 seconds has elapsed. then light the other fuse.

Dave's on firedave winer is stuck on a deserted island, with lots of trees, which is very thin and ten miles long (east to west). large cliffs surround the entire island and if he jumped off, he wouldn't survive the fall. a fire starts burning at the west side of the island. unfortunately this island always has a west to east blowing wind blowing at 2mph and this moves the fire slowly toward dave at 1mph. (so he only has ten hours left). save dave (or maybe, let him burn :-) ! what to do? 



Solution: dave's on fire
someone suggested he could dig a pit across the island to act as a firebreak. good suggestion, if he had a shovel and the ground wasn't too hard. 
but even if he didn't have a shovel, he could pick up a branch and run up to the fire and light the branch. then run all the way to the eastern edge of the island, but stop about a mile short. there he could light all those trees on fire and they would start burning and the fire would move east. it would consume all that vegetation in an hour, and then dave could wait for awhile for that part to cool down some. when the initial fire reached him, he could just run into the already burnt part, and the fire couldn't get him. 
T = treeD = daveB = burnt top view==========================| fire-> T T T T T T T D |========================== dave gets branch and lights it from fire==========================| fire-> D T T T T T T T |========================== dave lights trees farther east on the island==========================| fire-> T T T T D fire->|========================== dave waits until second fire cools, and then hides out there==========================| B B B fire-> T T B B D |==========================

Chessboard 
problem: using 31 dominoes, where one domino covers exactly two squares, can you cover all the empty squares on this chessboard (which has 62 spaces). if so, how? if not, why?
 

Solution: chessboard
problem: using 31 dominoes, where one domino covers exactly two squares, can you cover all the empty squares on this chessboard (which has 62 spaces). if so, how? if not, why? 

solution: i think everyone's first inclination is to try and figure out how it is possible. then again, if you've heard a bunch of these questions before, you usually know that if the question says "if not, why?" or "prove whether its possible or impossible", you can infer that it is not possible (otherwise, the question usually just asks for the solution). 
after awhile fiddling around with the dominoes, you will start to realize that the most obvious solutions are not viable. if you start to think its impossible, think about why. 
a reader emailed me telling me that using the picture of the chessboard without the squares colored will result in a very small percentage of people solving the problem. if i use the following picture 

a much higher percentage of people will be able to solve the problem. the people who solve the problem using only the grid, usually represent the problem in their heads as the colored board. 
still can't figure it out? using the colored board, remember that a domino always covers a black square and a white square. 
if you look at the board, you will see that the two squares missing are both black. this means that for all the squares on the board, each white square has a corresponding black square, except for two white ones. so even if you covered all the black/white pairs, you would still be left with two white squares, which will never be adjacent to each other, no matter how you lay out the dominoes.  


Easy river crossing
three cannibals and three anthropologists have to cross a river. the boat they have is only big enough for two people. if at any point in time there are more cannibals on one side of the river than anthropologists, the cannibals will eat them. what plan can the anthropologists use for crossing the river so they don't get eaten? 
remember! the boat can't cross the river by itself, someone has to be in it to row it across. 
a much harder river crossing problem will appear later this week.

note that if you violate the "anthropologists > cannibals" rule at any point in time, it is illegal.. for example if a boat with a cannibal and an anthropologist travels to a shore with one cannibal on it, then # cannibals > # anthropologists, even if you say the anthropologist immediately takes the boat back.

Shapes
part I: draw a square. divide it into four identical squares. remove the bottom left hand square. now divide the resulting shape into four identical shapes. 
part II: draw an equilateral triangle (all sides same length). divide it into four identical shapes. remove the bottom left hand shape. now divide the resulting shape into four identical shapes. 
this is the sort of problem that i would expect on a MENSA test. i'm not too sure whether getting this right constitutes intelligence in a way that would benefit computer scientists, but maybe it does. if you figure it out, then you can say it does. if you can't figure it out, then you can just say it's all hogwash and it's a stupid question.

Webloggers
five webloggers - joshua Allen, meg Hourihan, jason Kottke, robert Scoble, and joel Spolsky - were competing for karma points on the major search engines: google, yahoo, altavista, lycos, and msn. karma was distributed on a five point scale. the most popular weblog received 5 points, and the least popular received 1 point. for each search engine, no two webloggers received the same number of points. overall scores were determined by adding up the individual scores from each search engine. 
Allen got the highest number of karma points - 24. Kottke was consistent in his scores: he got the same karma points from 4 different search engines. Spolsky got 5 points from lycos, and 3 from msn. 
no two webloggers got the same total score, and the final rankings were as follows: Allen, Hourihan, Kottke, Scoble, and Spolsky. how many karma points did Hourihan get from lycos?

no two webloggers got the same total score, and the final rankings were as follows: Allen, Hourihan, Kottke, Scoble, and Spolsky. how many karma points did Hourihan get from lycos? 
solution: let's start with what we know 
     G   Y   A   L   M    Total   |============================ A |                        24 H | K | Sc| Sp|             5   3
the only possible values for Allen achieving 24 is { 5 5 5 5 4 } and since Spolsky got a 5 from lycos, we know that is where Allen's 4 comes from. 
we also know that the total number of points given out was 75.(5 * (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1)) 
spolsky had to have at least 11 points. if Spolsky had more than 11 points, say 12, then is it possible to achieve a solution? Scoble would have had to have at least 13 (since there were no ties), and Kottke 14, and Houlihan 15. that would yield an overall total of 78. too much! so Spolsky definitely had 11 points. 


     G   Y   A   L   M    Total   |============================ A | 5   5   5   4   5      24 H | K | Sc| Sp| 1   1   1   5   3      11
using the same logic as before, we also know that Scoble could not have gotten more than 12 points. if he had 13, and Kottke 14, and Houlihan 15, the total would be 77. still too much. so Scoble had 12, and continuing on Kottke had to have 13 and Houlihan 15, otherwise the totals would be over 75. 
now we know Kottke had 14 points. if he got four 4's for consistency, it wouldn't work (already over 16). if he got four 2's, it also wouldn't work (8 points plus the maximum 5 is still only 13). so he had to have received four 3's. and since he couldn't have gotten a 3 from msn, that is where he received a 1. 
     G   Y   A   L   M    Total   |============================ A | 5   5   5   4   5      24 H |                        15 K | 3   3   3   3   1      13 Sc|                        12 Sp| 1   1   1   5   3      11
let's look at scoble. we can see from the chart that all 5's and 3's have already been given out (and there is only one 1 left). so Scoble's scores can only contain 4's, 2's, or a single 1. given that information the only possible combination of 5 scores that would yield 12 is { 2 2 2 2 4 }. since Allen already has a 4 from lycos, Scoble must have a 2 there. 
     G   Y   A   L   M    Total   |============================ A | 5   5   5   4   5      24 H |                        15 K | 3   3   3   3   1      13 Sc|             2          12 Sp| 1   1   1   5   3      11
hence Houlihan must have a 1 from lycos! 
     G   Y   A   L   M    Total   |============================ A | 5   5   5   4   5      24 H |             1          15 K | 3   3   3   3   1      13 Sc|             2          12 Sp| 1   1   1   5   3      11


Hard river crossing
a disfunctional family has to cross the river. on one side of the river are a mom and 2 daughters, dad and 2 sons, the maid and the dog. there is a boat only big enough to hold 2 people (counting the dog as 1 person). only the adults are capable of operating the boat. everyone has to get to the other side, without anything bad happening. 
difficulties: if the dog is left with anyone and the maid isn't there to control him, he'll bite. the dad can't be left with any of the daughters when the mom isn't there. likewise, the mom can't be trusted alone with either of the sons when the dad isn't there. 
remember! only an adult can operate the boat, AND the boat can't drive itself.

Classic weighing
this is a classic problem which i have heard many times before. this is the "harder" of the two problems, since in this one, you do not know if the invalid item weighs more or less than the others. 
solving it is only half the battle. writing up a solution that anyone including your grandma could understand, is very hard. 
problem: the evil king from before sends his own assassin to take care of the evil queen who tried to poison him. of course, her trusty guards catch the assassin before any harm is done. the queen notices that the assassin is quite handsome and doesn't really want to punish him by death. she decides to test his wisdom. 
the queen gives the assassin 12 pills which are all completely identical in shape, smell, texture, size, except 1 pill has a different weight. the queen gives the man a balance and tells him that all the pills are deadly poison except for the pill of a different weight. the assassin can make three weighings and then must swallow the pill of his choice. if he lives, he will be sent back to the bad king's kingdom. if he dies, well, thats what you get for being an assassin. 
only one pill is not poison and it is the pill which has a different weight. the assassin does not know if it weighs more or less than the other pills. how can he save his skin?

only one pill is not poison and it is the pill which has a different weight. the assassin does not know if it weighs more or less than the other pills. how can he save his skin? 
solution: easy. 
choose any eight of the pills and put four of them on each side of the balance. 
there are two possibilities: 
(1) one side of the balance comes out lighter. In this case, you know that the abnormal (safe) pill is one of the pills already on the balance. label the pills on the lighter side A B C and D, and the pills on the heavier side E F G and H. label the pills not on the balance NORM (you know they’re normal pills). 
(2) the balance is even. in this case, you know that the abnormal (safe) pill is one of the pills not on the balance. label the pills already on the balance NORM, and label the four pills not on the balance I J K and L. 
let’s proceed with possibility (1). 
consider why the side ABCD came out higher than the side EFGH. this could be because: 
A is the abnormal pill, and it’s lighter than the other pills. 
B is the abnormal pill, and it’s lighter than the other pills. 
C is the abnormal pill, and it’s lighter than the other pills. 
D is the abnormal pill, and it’s lighter than the other pills. 
E is the abnormal pill, and it’s heavier than the other pills. 
F is the abnormal pill, and it’s heavier than the other pills. 
G is the abnormal pill, and it’s heavier than the other pills. 
H is the abnormal pill, and it’s heavier than the other pills. 
now let’s make another weighing, with two of the ABCD pills on either side, and one of the EFGH pills on either side. for example, let’s weigh ABE versus CDF. how would this weighing come out given each of those 8 possibilities we just listed? 
if A is the light pill, the ABE/CDF weighing will come out with ABE high. 
if B is the light pill, the ABE/CDF weighing will come out with ABE high. 
if C is the light pill, the ABE/CDF weighing will come out with ABE low. 
if D is the light pill, the ABE/CDF weighing will come out with ABE low. 
if E is the heavy pill, the ABE/CDF weighing will come out with ABE low. 
if F is the heavy pill, the ABE/CDF weighing will come out with ABE high. 
if G is the heavy pill, the ABE/CDF weighing will come out even. 
if H is the heavy pill, the ABE/CDF weighing will come out even. 
OK, so we observe how the ABE versus CDF weighing actually comes out. 
(a) if it comes out even, then we know that the abnormal pill is either G or H. for our third weighing, we can weigh G against one of the pills we already know to be normal (one of the pills we labelled NORM). if it comes out even, then G is normal and H must be the abnormal pill. if it comes out uneven, then G is the abnormal pill. 
(b) as we can see from our chart above, if the ABE/CDF weighing comes out with ABE high, then the situation is either: A is the light pill, B is the light pill, or F is the heavy pill. 
(c) as we can see from our chart above, if the ABE/CDF weighing comes out with ABE low, then the situation is either: C is the light pill, D is the light pill, or E is heavy pill. 
so in either situation (b) or (c), we have two possible light pills and one possible heavy pill. what we do in that case is we put one of the possible light pills and the possible heavy pill on one side of the scale, and two NORM pills on the other side of the scale. this is our third weighing. if it comes out even, then we know that the other possible light pill is the abnormal pill. if it comes out with the two NORM pills high, then we know that one of the pills on the other side is abnormally heavy, so we know that the possible heavy pill is the culprit. if it comes out with the two NORM pills low, then we know that one of the pills on the other side is abnormally light, so we know that the possible light pill on the scale is the culprit. 
that takes care of case (1), where the first weighing came out uneven. 
what about case (2), where the first weighing comes out even? 
then we know the abnormal pill is one of I J K or L, and we have two weighings to find the abnormal pill in. 
for our second weighing, we put I and J on one side of the scale, and two NORM pills on the other. 
(a) if this comes out uneven, we know the abnormal pill is I or J; we weigh I against one NORM pill to see if I is abnormal and if it isn’t, we can conclude that J is the abnormal pill. 
(b) if the IJ versus 2 NORM weighing comes out even, we know the abnormal pill is K or L; we weight K against one NORM pill to see if K is abnormal and if it isn’t, we can conclude that L is the abnormal pill. 
finished.

another well known problem in probability is the monty hall problem. 
you are presented with three doors (door 1, door 2, door 3). one door has a million dollars behind it. the other two have goats behind them. you do not know ahead of time what is behind any of the doors. 
monty asks you to choose a door. you pick one of the doors and announce it. monty then counters by showing you one of the doors with a goat behind it and asks you if you would like to keep the door you chose, or switch to the other unknown door. 
should you switch? if so, why? what is the probability if you don't switch? what is the probability if you do. 
lots of people have heard this problem.. so just knowing what to do isn't sufficient. its the explanation that counts!
Solution: monty hall problem
another well known problem in probability is the monty hall problem. 
you are presented with three doors (door 1, door 2, door 3). one door has a million dollars behind it. the other two have goats behind them. you do not know ahead of time what is behind any of the doors. 
monty asks you to choose a door. you pick one of the doors and announce it. monty then counters by showing you one of the doors with a goat behind it and asks you if you would like to keep the door you chose, or switch to the other unknown door. 
should you switch? if so, why? what is the probability if you don't switch? what is the probability if you do. 
lots of people have heard this problem.. so just knowing what to do isn't sufficient. its the explanation that counts! 
the answer is that yes, you should *always* switch as switching increases your chances from 1/3 to 2/3. how so, you ask? well, lets just enumerate the possibilities. 
           door 1       door 2       door 3case 1       $$          goat         goatcase 2      goat          $$          goatcase 3      goat         goat          $$
its clear that if you just choose a door and stick with that door your chances are 1/3. 
using the switching strategy, let's say you pick door 1. if its case 1, then you lose. if it's case 2, monty shows you door 3, and you switch to door 2, you win. if it's case 3, monty shows you door 2, and you switch to door 3, you win. it doesn't matter what door you pick in the beginning, there are always still three possibilities. one will cause you to lose, and two will cause you to win. so your chances of winning are 2/3. 
the solution all resides in the fact that monty knows what is behind all the doors and therefore always eliminates a door for you, thereby increasing your odds. 
maybe its easier to see in this problem. there are 1000 doors, only one of which has a prize behind it. you pick a door, then monty opens 998 doors with goats behind them. do you switch? it seems more obvious in this case, because monty had to take care in which door not to open, and in the process basically showing you where the prize was (999 out of 1000 times).



Switches puzzle  aha:!
This one was recently given on Car Talk, and it's been making the rounds right now also... 
The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, "You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another. 
"In the prison is a switch room, which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. I am not telling you their present positions. The switches are not connected to anything. 
"After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell. 
"No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back. 
"But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time anyone of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.' and be 100% sure. 
"If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators." 
What is the strategy they come up with so that they can be free?


Cars on the road  aha:!
If the probability of observing a car in 20 minutes on a highway is 609/625, what is the probability of observing a car in 5 minutes (assuming constant default probability)?
Split the 20 minute observation period into 4 intervals of 5 minutes.Assume a constant default probability of p.Now, repeatedly apply the following two formulas:probability(x or y) = probability(x) + probability (y) - probability(x and y)probability(x and y) = probability(x) x probability(y)Where x (or y) is the observation of a car in 5 minute period.This will give:4p - 6p^2 + 4p^3 - p^4 = 609/625Which be can be rearranged as:1 - (1 - p)^4 = 609/625Rseolving for p gives:p = 3/5
Sajid Umerji Thursday, December 30, 2004 
Oops, I was just watching the new year's fireworks and it just occured to me that there is a simpler solution to this puzzle :-)As before, split the the 20 minute observation period into 4 intervals of 5 minutes and let p be the constant default probability of observing a car in a 5 minute period.The probability that one does not observe a car in 20 minutes is1 - 609/625 = 16/625Now, the probability of one does not observe a car in a 5 minute period is (1 - p) And therefore the probability that one does not observe a car in any of the 4 consecutive 5 minute periods (i.e. in 20 minutes) is (1 - p)^4Therefore(1 - p)^4 = 16/625Resolving for p givesP = 3/5 
Sajid Umerji Friday, December 31, 2004 
I think the answe of p=3/5 is only valid if the question is changed to "If the probability of observing AT LEAST a car in 20 mins..."If the question is "If the probability of observing ONLY a car in 20 min...", the answer p = [609/625]/4

Railroad bridge  aha:!!
i got some new brain teasers and more classic programming puzzles for everyone!
a man needs to go through a train tunnel.  he starts through the tunnel and when he gets 1/4 the way through the tunnel, he hears the train whistle behind him. you don't know how far away the train is, or how fast it is going, (or how fast he is going).  all you know is that 
if the man turns around and runs back the way he came, he will just barely make it out of the tunnel alive before the train hits him. 
if the man keeps running through the tunnel, he will also just barely make it out of the tunnel alive before the train hits him.
assume the man runs the same speed whether he goes back to the start or continues on through the tunnel.  also assume that he accelerates to his top speed instantaneously.  assume the train misses him by an infintisimal amount and all those other reasonable assumptions that go along with puzzles like this so that some wanker doesn't say the problem isn't well defined.
how fast is the train going compared to the man?

First, is it a bridge or a tunnel?  I shall call it a brunnel.Here is my solution, which may well be incorrect.Let d be the distance between the train and the end of the brunnel.  Let l be the length of the brunnel.  Then dude is l/4 from the same end of the brunnel as the train.  Let vt be the velocity of the train and vd be the velocity of dude.It is given that dude can arrive at the end of the brunnel nearer the train at the same time the train will arrive there.  Therefore, l/4vd=d/vt.It is also given that dude can arrive at the far end of the brunnel at the same time as the train.  Therefore, 3l/4vd=(d+l)/vt.Finally, we know that dude (and the train) travel the same speed no matter which way dude runs, so we know that the second equation equals three times the first equation.  Therefore, 3d/vt=(d+l)/vt.Solving this system of equations, we find that vt/vd=2.  The train is traveling twice as fast as dude.  Either dude is a sprinter or the train takes it slow while approaching brunnels.So...Is this an appropriate interview question?  It is a Physics 100 problem.  I am shockingly bad at correctly solving most of these puzzles, but since I've studied physics, this problem was relatively straightforward for me.Similarly, since probability is so counter-intuitive, probability questions like the Cars On The Road problem are much better indicators of whether a person has studied probability than whether that person is a generally capable problem solver.  A specific example: Paul Hoffman writes in The Man Who Loved Only Numbers (a very entertaining biography of Paul Erdos, which I recommend to probably anyone who would read this web site) that when Marilyn vos Savant posed the solution to the Monty Hall Dilemma, well-respected mathematicians wrote in from all over the country telling her that she could not possibly be right (though of course she was).I find that people answer most probability questions correctly if and only if they have studied probability problems.  Thus this is a great metric if you're writing time series prediction software or whatnot, but otherwise, what does it tell you about general problem solving ability?I would certainly be impressed if someone uninitiated in the domain were to attack a probability question or a physics question (or any other question whose solution is straightforward if and only if one has studied the relevant domain) with enough care and clarity to arrive at a solution, but I would not expect it.  Do others?  Are my standards unrealistically low?  Am I just making a long-winded case to make myself feel less stupid?
M Friday, December 31, 2004 
Provided that the question does not demand specialist knowledge then one would expect a sufficiently talented candidate to make a good attempt at solving it.For example, the Monty Hall problem can be solved by visualising the problem in the right way and does not really require performing any calculations at all.The calculations are usually written down to convince people who can't 'see' the solution.Ofcourse, the question is what counts as specialist knowledge ? For example, would Pythagoras' Theorem count as specialist knowledge ? I would argue not, but where do you draw the line ?Anyway, this particular question can be solved without any knowledge of physics.To make the arithmetic easier, assume the length of the tunnel is 4 (lenght units).The man is 1/4 of the distance into the tunnel and therefore the ratio of his distance from the two ends of the tunnel is 3 : 1Let d be the distance between the train and tunnel.Then the ratio of the train's distance form the two ends of the tunnel will be 4 + d : dBut these two ratios must be equal if the train's speed is a constant multiple of the man's speed, therefore:(4 + d)/d = 3/1Which can be resolved asd = 2Now that we've got the location of the train, it is easy to see that speed of the train will be twice that of the man. For example, by noting that to meet at the nearest end of the tunnel at the same time, the man will have to travel one unit and the train will have to travel to units in the same time period. 
Sajid Umerji Friday, December 31, 2004 
In the final sentence above I meant to type:... and the train will have to travel TWO units in the same time period. 
Sajid Umerji Friday, December 31, 2004 
How about this solution: since the man is 1/4 inside the tunnel, if he goes away from the train it will be at 1/2 when the train reaches the tunnel (during the time it takes the train to reach the tunnel, the man can travel 1/4 of the tunnel), and because they both reach the other end at the same time, it means the train travels twice as fast... 
Radu Monday, January 03, 2005 
In response to M, I would say that probability problems are totally appropriate, precisely because they're unintuitive.  Most readers here are concerned with interviews for computer programming jobs.  Computer programming is inherantly unintuitive.  You need to sit down and draw pictures to make sense of it.  Similarly, if you sit down and draw pictures and have a rudimentary understanding of probability, you can solve any probability problem.The important thing that interviewers look for is, "Does the interviewee sit down and draw pictures and thing logically, through a process, or does he go with [blind] intuition?"  A tenacious, analytical problem solver (which the interviewer is looking for), even without probability background, will do well enough with probability problems, if he draws pictures, presents an idea, and backs it up.You can't go with intuition most of the time in programming, or engineering, or medicine, or, well, most anything analytical.  Even if you'd be safe 9/10 of the time, screwing up is often quite costly in jobs requiring analytical problem solving skills. 
Alex! Friday, January 07, 2005 
hifirst of all lets assume that the man is running away from the train. irrespective of whether the man runs towardsthe train or away from it the train shall reach the entrance of the tunnel after 1 sec. the man at this point of time has already come halfway through the tunnel.so in 2 sec he has to cover half the lenght of the tunnel and the train the entire lenght of the tunnel.hence the man is half as fast as the train.

Chameleons  aha:!
"at one point, a remote island's population of chameleons was divided as follows: 
13 red chameleons 
15 green chameleons 
17 blue chameleons 
each time two different colored chameleons would meet, they would change their color to the third one. (i.e.. If green meets red, they both change their color to blue.) is it ever possible for all chameleons to become the same color? why or why not?"
Before I start:x := y (mod 3) Means  thatx = (multiple of 3) + yHere are 2 examples to make the notation clear:10 := 1 (mod 3) because 10 = (3 x 3) + 1-4 := 2  (mod 3) because -4 = (3 x -2) + 2Now, let B and R denote the number of blue and red chameleons respectively.I will now show that B - R := 1 (mod 3) is always true.(i)  Before the first change occurs we haveB - R = 17 - 13 = 4 := 1 (mod 3)(ii) Now, suppose it is true after a certain number of changes, then at the next change we have 3 possibilities:One red and one blue chameleon combine to form 2 green ones. In which casenew B - new R = (B - 1) - (R - 1) = B - R := 1 (mod 3) One red and one green chameleon combine to form 2 blue ones. In which casenew B - new R = (B + 2) - (R - 1) = (B - R) + 3 := b - r := 1 (mod 3)One blue and one green chameleon combine to form 2 red ones. In which casenew B - new R = (B - 1) - (R + 2) = (B - R) - 3 := b - r := 1 (mod 3)By (i) and (ii) we have established that B - R := 1 (mod 3) is always true.Now, I will show that if all the chameleons become the same colour then B - R := 0 (mod 3)I've listed the three possibilites below with the appropriate calculations for B - R.R    G    B45  0    0    B - R = -45 = 3 X (-15) := 0 (mod 3)0    45  0      B - R = 0 := 0 (mod 3)0    0  45    B - R = 45 = 3 x 15 := 0 (mod 3)To summarise, all the chameleons cannot become the same colour because in that case we would have:B - R := 0 (mod 3)Whereas, we have proved that B - R := 1 (mod 3)is always true.
Sajid Umerji Thursday, December 30, 2004 
>>x := y (mod 3) >>>>Means  that>>>>x = (multiple of 3) + yThat mod notation really bothers me.  It detracts the formality and elegance of the proof.What if I say10 := 4 (mod 3) because 10 = (3 x 2) + 4or-4 := -1  (mod 3) because -4 = (3 x -1) + -1What we have shown is that even thoughB - R := 1 (mod 3)is always true, that does not mean it cannot be something else.B - R := 4 (mod 3) could also be true.The proof relies on the assumption thatB - R := 1 (mod 3)is always true implies nothing else can be true, thereforeB - R := 0 (mod 3)can never be true.However, that assumption is false, although the result of the proof is true. 
JHY Thursday, December 30, 2004 
It's true thatB - R := 4 (mod 3)However, ifx := y (mod 3)Then y can be ultimately reduced to one and only one of the numbers from the set {0, 1, 2 } 
Sajid Umerji Friday, December 31, 2004 
It's a little more complicated than that:B - R can equal 1 or 2 % 3, and you have to show that in either case it can never end up at 0 % 3, but otherwise your solution works. 
Erik Monday, January 03, 2005 
Another solution: after each color change, the difference between the population of different colors can either remain the same or change by 3. Since the inital difference between populations is initially 2 and 4, it is not possible to reach a difference of 0 following any sequence of color changes (which at most changes the difference by 3). This even proves that two different colors can never have the same population (i.e. difference=0), be it zero or more. 
Radu Tuesday, January 04, 2005 
Since we seem to like Red and Blue... R +2G -1B -1 (net change to R-B = 3 .. call this delta1)R -1G +2B -1 (net change to R-B = 0 .. delta2)R -1G -1G +2 (net change to R-B = -3 .. delta3)We know that the initial value of R-B = 4It should be obvious that Adding 3, 0, or -3 to 4 will never yield 45 (13+15+17).after some number of meetings (x+y+z)new R-B = original R-B + x(delta1) + y(delta2) + z(delta3)new R-B = 4 + 3x + 0y - 3znew R-B = 1 + 3(1 + x - z)45 = 3k where k = 150 = 3k where k = 0R-B = 3k + 13k + 1 is never equal to 3kthus R-B can be neither 45 nor 0, and the cameleons will never be the all same color. 
Will Smith Thursday, January 06, 2005 
I agree with Will because it's what I proved in my original post but none of the subsequent posters seemed to agree with me. 
Sajid Umerji Friday, January 07, 2005 
A non algabraic solution just occured to me. Since there are 13 red chameleons, 15 green, and 17 red. Since there are not the same number of chameleons of any color, so it is impossible for all the chameleons to become the same color, since this would require all red (for example) to combine with green so that all the chameleons would be blue. After all this, there would still be left 2 green chameleons left which wouldn't be able to become blue without other red chameleons. One of them could combine with a blue chameleon to become 2 reds, and then one red could combine with a green, leaving only 1 red left over, and so nothing more could happen, except changing of the color of chameleon left over. 
Gregory Johnson Tuesday, January 11, 2005 
Suppose there are 12 red, 15 green, and 17 blue.Then a green and a blue can meet leaving us with14 red, 14 green and 16 blue.You don't have to start with two colors with the same count to end up with valid set.In the case of 13, 15 and 17, there can never be two colors with the same count.  The net change (in the difference between two colors) is always 0 or 3.if 12R, 15G, 17Bthen R-G= -3, R-B= -5, G-B= -2now let G & B meetthen 14R, 14G, 16B gives R-G= 0, R-B= -2, G-B= -2notice the change in R-G = 3,R-B = 3,G-B = 0Cheers

Crazy guy on the airplane  aha:!
"a line of 100 airline passengers is waiting to board a plane. they each hold a ticket to one of the 100 seats on that flight. (for convenience, let's say that the nth passenger in line has a ticket for the seat number n.) 
unfortunately, the first person in line is crazy, and will ignore the seat number on their ticket, picking a random seat to occupy. all of the other passengers are quite normal, and will go to their proper seat unless it is already occupied. if it is occupied, they will then find a free seat to sit in, at random. 
what is the probability that the last (100th) person to board the plane will sit in their proper seat (#100)?"
Answer: The jumping stops if someone sits on the crazy man's seat before the 100th persons, hence, the 100th will sit in his/her seat for sure then. Similarly, if anyone sits on the 100th passengers seat at any point, then he/she won't get to sit his/her seat for sure. If at any point someone picks a random seat other than #1 or #100, then the jumping is postponed till that seat number is reached. At any jumping point there is a equal probability that seats #1 or #100 will be chosen (other choices will just delay the problem till later down the line). By symmetry, the probability of the 100th passenger sitting in their seat is 50-50, since at all jump points there's an equal probability of choosing seats #1 or 100.
If any passenger <100 randomly selects seat 1, then each successive passenger can sit in his/her assigned seat including passenger 100. If any passenger <100 randomly selects seat 100, then passenger 100 is forced to choose the only other remaining seat.For each passenger (who is forced to choose randomly), the chance of choosing 1 and 100 is equal. (The EXACT probability depends on the number of other remaining seats, but in each case the chance of choosing 1 and 100 is the same. 1/100 and 1/100 for the 1st passenger, 1/40 and 1/40 for the 60th passenger)Each choice that doesn't choose seat 1 or 100 simply defers the final decision to a later passenger.Therefore the chance of passenger 100 getting his own seat is 50%.I had a nice proof by induction in a previous thread, but that thread has apparently been pruned. 


Let us consider the various possibilities one by one -1. If the crazy guy sits on seat 1 [ which he will not], then all is well [ all other people will sit on their respective seat numbers]. So the 100th guy will definitely find his seat vacant and he will then occupy it.2. If the crazy guy seats on seat 100, then the 100th guy can not occupy his seat [ although he will find exactly one other seat ].3. Now consider other 98 events [ crazy guy seating on any seat number between 2 and 99 [ both inclusive]. Let us start from 99.1. If he seats on 99, then all the people between [2-98] will occupy their respective positions. The 99 guy will come and will see his seat occupied. At this point, he has 2 choices 1 and 100. He can choose to sit on any one of them with equal probability of 1/2. So the 100th guy getting 100th seat is also 1/2.2. If he seats on 98, then people between [2-97] will occupy their seats. 98th guy comes and he has 3 choices 1,  99 and 100 with equal probability of 1/3. Suppose he chooses 1, then 99th guy will seat on his seat and 100th guy on his. So we have 1/3 possibility in this case. Suppose the 98th guy seats on 99 [with probability 1/3], then 99 has 2 choices 1 and 100 which as we have already seen got equal probability of 1/2. So the 100th guy getting his seat in this case is 1/3 + 1/3*(1/2) = 1/2  Here also we got the probability of 1/2 again.If we continue like this backwards for 97, 96, 95... we would get probability of 1/2 each time.  -3. For 97, it will be like P(1) = 1/4P(98) = 1/4 so 100th guy getting his seat is (1/4) * (1/2) = (1/8)P(99) = 1/4 so 100th guy getting his seat is (1/4) * (1/2) = (1/8).So total = (1/4) + (1/8) + (1/8) = 1/2.Probability of crazy guy 1 choosing any number between 2-100 is 1/99. So total probability is 1/99 * [ 1/2 + 1/2 + ... + 98 times + 0 ] = (1/99) * (98//2) = 0.494949....P.S. Since this is my first posting, let me know whether my analysis is correct or wrong !
shailesh nirgudkar Friday, December 10, 2004 
The answer is one chance in two. You're basically right. 
Stephen Jones Friday, December 10, 2004 
Everything was fine until this statement.>Probability of crazy guy 1 choosing any number between >2-100 is 1/99. So total probability is >1/99 * [ 1/2 + 1/2 + ... + 98 times + 0 ] = (1/99) * (98//2) >= 0.494949....Why only consider seats 2-100?  Seat #1 is very important.  So the conclusion is like this.Probability of crazy guy choosing a particular seat between 1-100 is 1/100.Crazy guy chooses seat #1, probability that 100th guy get own seat is 1.Seats between 2-99, probability that 100th guy get own seat is 1/2.Seat #100, probability that 100th guy get own seat is 0.Sum up all probabilities, 1/100 * (1 + 1/2 * 98) = 1/2 
JHY Friday, December 10, 2004 
As the first guy was going to ignore their seat number, I assumed that he will also igonre his own seat number. If he sits on his own number i.e. 1, can we say that he ignored his own number but still choose '1' randomly ?? 
shailesh nirgudkar Monday, December 13, 2004 
Yes.  His random action just happens to line up with his actual assignment.Imagine you're a school teacher and you've carefully assigned seats to each child by placing a piece of cardboard on each desk in your room.  The children enter and randomly seat themselves.  One may appear to be in the correct position to you, but to the child the position is completely random.  Ask them to randomly shuffle and you may find another coincidental alignment, but it doesn't signify special knowledge on the part of the children. 


Wanna play?  aha:!
i offer to play a card game with you using a normal deck of 52 cards.  the rules of the game are that we will turn over two cards at a time.  if the cards are both black, they go into my pile.  if they are both red, they go into your pile.  if there is one red and one black, they go into the discard pile.  we repeat the two card flipping until we've gone through all 52 cards.  whoever has more cards in their pile at the end wins.  i win if there is a tie.  if you win, i pay you a dollar.  how much would you pay to play this game?
Solution: wanna play?
I wouldn't give you a penny for that game. Here's why.Let's say all the color pairs are matched. That means 13 red pairs, 13 black pairs, you win. Now let's say there is 12 red pairs in the deck, we pick them all from the top of the deck. With the 28 remaining card, there will always be exactly 12 black pairs and two mixed pairs. Why? Two red cards in the stack, they can't be in a pair, otherwise you would get a total of 13 pairs, and I would too since all the black cards would be together. So the two red cards are matched with one black card each, leaving 24 black cards together, I get the same number of pairs as you do and you win.Same math with 11 red pairs. That means four red cards in mixed pairs, hence 22 black cards left together, or 11 pairs.No matter how mixed up the cards are, it's a tie, and you win. Hence, I wouldn't give you a penny.
Better Solution to "Wanna Play?" 
The published solution is correct, but I think there is a clearer / simpler solution possible ... you judge.Answer: do not pay anything to play  the game, you will always lose ... here is why:At the end of the game, there will be an equal number of red and black cards in the discard pile. (always 1 red and 1 black card is added to the discard pile together - hence there is always an equal number of red and black cards in the pile)Of the cards remaining, there will also be an equal number of red and black cards. (This is by subtraction - the initial pack of cards has an equal number of reds and blacks. From this pack we remove an equal number of reds and blacks to place on the discard pile) These remaining cards will be in our piles which must be of equal size. Therefore always a guaranteed tie.


Smart cookie  aha:?
did you ever wonder how they make those pillsbury cookie dough rolls with the intricate faces inside them?  scroll about halfway down the page here and notice the intricate design they have somehow injected into their cookie rolls?  if you examine the roll closely there is no seam between the normal dough and the colored shape, but somehow they get that inside the roll.  i emailed them asking them how they do it and they told me it was "doughboy magic". 

Solution: smart cookie
I don't know if this is right or not, but it sounds pretty darn close to the best idea I've heard yet.

"I assume these are made the same way designs are put in the center of taffy candies.The designs are made by taking advantage of the fact that the dough is soft and pliable.They take the dough and make the design at a large diameter and thickness. The diameter could a foot or more. At this scale the design does not have to be very precise. Extrusion methods like the playdough presses would work.They then take the giant dough cylinder with the rough design and then roll it into a "snake" just like kids do with balls of playdoh. As the "snake" gets longer the design in the center gets uniformly smaller. The "snake" is then cut into pieces and put in packaging.To get a more precise designs simply requires increasing the starting diameter. The engineering difficulty then lies in rolling the snake out.An alternative to rolling would be to use a press to extrude the dough using a funnel shaped press. The engineering difficulty with a press would be to shape the press, and exert uniform pressure so the dough coming out is a shrunken version of the original."


XOR using NAND gates 
I can't remember if I saw this on the discussion board or somewhere else... 
Create an XOR gate using only NAND gates.  (BTW, mostly all circuit problems assume you have two inputs plus 0 and 1 also as inputs).
I solved it using 6 NAND gates (might be possible with less).XOR:0 0 - 00 1 - 11 0 - 11 1 - 0NAND:0 0 - 10 1 - 11 0 - 11 1 - 0Difficult to describe in text but i'll try.Call the two inputs A and B.Connect A to a 1 and call this gate (A1). Same with (B1). The third nand is with A and B, lets call it (AB). Connect (A1) and (B1) and call it ((A1)(B1)). Connecting this to (AB) will give us (((A1)(B1))(AB)).(((A1)(B1))(AB)):0 0 - 10 1 - 01 0 - 01 1 - 1Which is the inverse of XOR. This is fixed by using a 6th nand and connecting it to (((A1)(B1))(AB)) and 1.((((A1)(B1))(AB))1)
I've seen it before, so I won't give it away.  But a hint:  It can be done with four. 
Yes 4 gates, and you don't need any constant inputs Hint:  not(AB) = not(A) + not(B) 
Ah, finally solved it. The solution is very symmetrical and pretty. I guess my hint will be: Remember that you can use the output from one gate as input to two different gates. 


X implies y  aha:!!
Part I
(you can't use paper, you have to figure it out in your head)
i have a black triangle, a white triangle, a black circle and a white circle.  if i gave you a shape (triangle or circle) and a color (black or white), the "frobby" items would be those that had either the shape or the color, but not both.  that is, in order to be frobby, the item must be of the specified color OR the specified shape, but not both the specified shape AND the specified color.  i'm thinking of a shape and a color in my head and i tell you that the white triangle is frobby.  can you tell me the "frobbiness" of the other items?
Part II
there are four cards which have a letter on one side and a number on the other side.  i lay them out and the cards appear as 2 5 F E.  the rule is that a card with an odd number on one side must have a vowel on the other.  what is the minimum number of cards you should turn over to prove the rule is true (and which cards would they be)?

Part I: Answer: Yes.Solution: White Triangle is "frobby" Therefore the shape that is being thought of is either Black Triangle or White Circle.  For both of these, the other "frobby" shape is the Black Circle.Part II: Answer: 2; card 5 and card FSolution: The key to this solution is to read the question carefully, especially this sentance:"a card with an odd number on one side must have a vowel on the other"There are no other rules! No rule that cards with vowels on one side must have odd numbers on the other side, no rule that cards with even numbers must have consonants, etc, etc ...Going through the 4 cards:Card "2" : must not be turned.  As this card does not have an odd number on one side, we do not care what letter is on the other side.Card "5": Must check that the other side is a vowel to prove the rule.Card "F": Must check that the other side is NOT an odd number - if it is then the rule would be proved false.Card "E": This is a vowel, therefore it deosnt matter whether or not the other side is odd.


Technical riddles  aha:!!
You have an empty room, and a group of people waiting outside the room. At each step, you may either get one person into the room, or get one out. Can you make subsequent steps, so that every possible combination of people is achieved exactly once?






Even harder coin problem  aha:!
some of you may have easily solved the pill weighing problem posed here. if so you are going to love this problem. 
it is similar but much more difficult.

Box o' numbers  aha:!
arrange the numbers 1 to 8 in the grid below such that adjacent numbers are not in adjacent boxes (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). 
       ___      | 1 |  =============  | 6 | 4 | 3 |  =============  | 2 | 7 | 5 |  =============      | 8 |      =====
the arrangement above, for example, is wrong because 3 & 4, 4 & 5, 6 & 7, and 7 & 8 are adjacent. 
Solution: box o' numbers
The key (as I see it) is putting the 1 & 8 in the centre spots - which is required, because those spots both border all but one of the other spots, and 1 & 8 are the only numbers that are only adjacent to one number. 
From there, the 2 & 7 are forced, then you have your choice of the next number, which then forces the rest. Really, though there are only two valid solutions, and they are mirror images of each other. 


Mensa  aha:!
if "24 H in a D" means "24 hours in a day", what does "26 L of the A" mean? what about the other 32 puzzles here on my mensa forward reproduction page? 


Hen  aha:!!!
if a hen and a half lay an egg and a half in a day and a half, how many hens does it take to lay six eggs in six days? 

solution: hen
if 1.5 hens lay 1.5 eggs in 1.5 days (or 36 hours) then: 1 hen lays 1 egg in 1,5 days or 4 eggs in six days thus 1.5 hens lay 6 eggs in 6 days


Duel  aha:!!
you find yourself in a duel with two other gunmen. you shoot with 33% accuracy, and the other two shoot with 100% and 50% accuracy, respectively. the rules of the duel are one shot per-person per-round. the shooting order is from worst shooter to best shooter, so you go first, the 50% guy goes second, and the 100% guy goes third. 
where or who should you shoot at in round 1? 
Solution: duel
You have 3 options to consider: 
(1) Shoot at 50% guy. Death comes with: 72% likilhood (2) Shoot at the 100% guy. Death comes with: 63.64% likihood (3) Shoot into the air (purposely miss). Death comew with 58.33% likihood. 
So, you shoot into the air and hope for the best. 
Calculations: 
The p in the probabilities below represents your probability of dying at some point if you MISS either guy in the first round. It'll be filled in later. 
(1) if you shoot at the 50% guy and get him, you're guaranteed to get shot the next round. 
prob of dying at some point by aiming at the 50% guy: 
(=) (33.3%)(100%)+(66.67%)*(p) 
(=) (33.3%)+(66.67%)(p) 
(2) if you shoot at the 100% guy and get him, you're left with this geometric sum of probability of getting shot by the 50% guy at some point in the future...it converges. 
(=) [(50%)] + 
[(50%)(66.67%)(50%)] + 
[(50%)(66.67%)(50%)(66.67%)(50%)] + ... 
(=) 50% * { 1 + (1/3) + (1/3)^2 + ... } 
(=) 50% * {3/2) 
(=) 75% 
so, your prob of getting shot if you shoot at the 100% guy is: 
(=) (33.3%)(75%)+(66.67%)(p) 
(=) (24.75%) + (66.67%)(p) 
still crummy, but it dominates the alternative, for positive p. 
(3) What happens if you miss? ie, what's (p)? 
if you miss, the second guy has a choice to make...does he shoot at you, or the other guy? his options: 
(1) Shoot you: if he gets you, he's guaranteed to die on the next shot. 
if he misses, he has q chance of dying (which we'll get later). 
(=) (50%)(100%)+(50%)(q) 
(=) (50%)+(0.5)(q) 
(2) Shoot at the 100% dude: 
If he gets the 100% guy, there some infinite sum representing his probability of getting shot by you: 
[(33.33%)] + 
[(66.67%)(50%)(33.33%)] + 
[(66.67%)(50%)(66.67%)(50%)(33.33%)] + ... 
(=) 33.33% * [ 1 + (1/3) + (1/3)^2 + ... ] 
(=) 33.33% * [(3/2)] 
(=) (50.0%) 
So, he chances of getting shot if he shoots at the 100% guy are: 
(=) (50%)*(50%) + (50%)(q) 
(=) (25%)+(.5)q 
No matter what q is, he'd prefer shooting the 100% guy to shooting you. 
Now, what happens if *he* misses (the 100%) guy? ie, what's q? if he misses, then the 100% guy has to make a decision: 
(1) Shoot you: 
he's guaranteed to get you, so his chances of dying are just 50%. (game ends after the next round...the 50% gets only one shot) 
prob of dying: 50% 
(2) Shoot the 50% guy: 
by the same logic, he'd have a 33.33% chance of death (getting shot by you). 
So, he prefers to shoot the 50% guy. 
So, q is 100% (ie, if the 50% guy misses, the 100% guy shoots him immediately). From that, we know the 50% guy's optimal move, if everyone's around on his first shot. He'd prefer shooting at the 100% guy to shooting at you or purposely missing. 
Now, we need to get p, which is our probability of dying if we purposely miss either guy (shoot into the air). 
We know the 50% guy shoots at the 100% guy if we miss. 
(1) With 50% probability, the 50% guy kills the 100% guy, resulting in a shootout b/w us and the 50% guy. 
(=) (50%) * [ (66.67%)*(50%) + (66.67%)*(50%)*(66.67%)(50%) + ... 
(=) (50%) * [ (1/3) + (1/3)^2 + ... ] 
(=) (50%) * [0.5] 
(=) (25%) 
(2) He misses him. Then, we get one shot at the 100% guy (after the 100% guy shoots the 50% guy). 
Our chances of death are: 
(50%)*(66.67%) = (33.33%) 
So, p is (25%)+(33.33%) = 58.3% 
So, again, our three choices are 
(1) Shoot at 50% guy. Death comes with: 
(=) (33.3%)+(66.67%)(p) 
(=) 72% likilhood 
(2) Shoot at the 100% guy. Death comes with: 
(=) (24.75%) + (66.67%)(p) 
(=) 63.64% likihood 
(3) Shoot into the air (purposely miss). 
(=) p 
(=) 58.33% likelihood.


Vienna  aha:!!
it's the middle ages, you're travelling across europe and you want to find the way to vienna. you come to a crossroads, now there are two ways to go. at the crossroads stand a knight and a knave. the knight answers every question truthfully. the knave answers every question falsely. you don't know which guy is which. how can you figure out which road leads to Vienna by only asking one question? 
Solution: vienna
Many people try "what would the other man say if I asked him which way to Vienna?" But for that to work, the knight would have to know that the other man is a knave, and the knave would have to know that the other man is a knight; it's not clear that either of these is a given. 
To cope with that, you can ask "assuming the other man has the opposite predilection regarding truth-telling from what you do, what would he say if I asked him which way to Vienna?" 
More interestingly, you can ask "if you were to ask yourself which way to Vienna, what would you say?" But before risking that question, I'd want a few more details about how the knave is wired up. What does it mean, to lie to oneself? Is such a thing even possible, regardless of what psychoanalysts might claim? 
Furthermore, travelling through Europe in the middle ages, it's a bit of a rash assumption that people you meet at a crossroad would understand English. If you only have 1 question, you have to frame a question that is meaningful in all locally spoken languages (like writing a program that is both legal Fortran and legal C). Your question doesn't have to mean exactly the same thing in each language, as long as each possible answer carries in itself an indication of which language it is in. 
Or you could try the universal language of mime. Say "Vienna" and open your arms wide with a questioning look. But how would you mime "if you were to ask the other man ..." (or "if you were to ask yourself ...") ?


Oil mogul  aha:!
you are an oil mogul considering the purchase of drilling rights to an as yet unexplored tract of land. 
the well's expected value to its current owners is uniformly distributed over [$1..$100]. (i.e., a 1% chance it's worth each value b/w $1..$100, inclusive). 
bcause you have greater economies of scale than the current owners, the well will actually be worth 50% more to you than to them (but they don't know this). 
the catch: although you must bid on the well before drilling starts (and hence, before the actual yield of the well is known), the current owner can wait until *after* the well's actual value is ascertained before accepting your bid or not. 
what should you bid? 
Solution: oil mogul
This problem amounts to properly defining the expected value of the well to you. 
The following equation does it: 
(1%) * [(1.5 - 1)] + 
(1%) * [(3 - 2) + (1.50 - 2)] + 
(1%) * [(4.5 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (1.5 - 3)] + 
. . . 
(1%) * [(150-100) + ... + (3-100) + (1.5-100)] 
Each line represents your expected value from a bid of 1$, 2$, ..., 100$, respectively. 
eg, consider line 2 above. if you bid $2... 
With 98% probability you won't win the contract, so your profit is 0. With 1% probability, you will win something worth (150%*1) = 1.5, for which you paid 2$ With 1% probability, you will something worth worth (150%*2) = 3, for which you paid 2$ 
So, your goal is to maximize the following function of x, where x is your bid. 
f(x) = 1% * Sum_{i = 1 to floor(x)}{ x - 1.5*i } 
There's no benefit to non-integer bets, so re-write the maximization function as : 
ARGMAX(k) {1% * Sum_{i = 1 to k}{1.5*i - k}} 
(=) ARGMAX(k) {Sum_{i=1 to k}{1.5*i - k}} /* 1% isn't a function of k or i, so toss it */ 
(=) ARGMAX(k) {Sum_{i=1 to k}{1.5*i} - Sum_{i=1 to k}{k}} /* Split the summation */ 
(=) ARGMAX(k) {(0.75)(K)(K+1) - K^2 }} /* Closed form for summations */ 
(=) ARGMAX(k) {(0.75)(k)-(0.25)(K^2)}} /* Algebra */ 
And that function is maximized at k = 1 and k = 2. 
When choosing b/w $1 and $2, you should bid $1 because of time-value, reinvestment risk, etc, of the extra dollar. 
(ie, if you don't have to spend the extra $$ now, don't) 
That's my solution. 


100 factorial  aha:!
how many trailing zeroes are there in 100! (100 factorial)? 
Solution: 100 factorial
One per factor of 10, and one per factor of 5 (there are more than enough 2's to pair with the 5's), plus one per factor of ten squared (one occurrence) and one per factor of 5 squared (three occurrences). 
So if I'm counting correctly, that'd be 10 + 10 + 1 + 3== 24 zeroes. 
Assuming the question meant *trailing* zeroes. It'd be much harder to also count the intermingled zero digits in the entire expansion.



World series  aha:!
you have $10,000 dollars to place a double-or-nothing bet on the Yankees in the World Series (max 7 games, series is over once a team wins 4 games). 
unfortunately, you can only bet on each individual game, not the series as a whole. how much should you bet on each game, so that, if the yanks win the whole series, you expect to get 20k, and if they lose, you expect 0? 
basically, you know that there may be between 4 and 7 games, and you need to decide on a strategy so that whenever the series is over, your final outcome is the same as an overall double-or-nothing bet on the series.
Solution: world series
this probably isn't the cleanest solution, but... 
a dynamic-programming type solution is: 
(1) Create a 5x5 matrix P. 
So, P[i,j] holds your pile of money when the yanks have won i games and the mets have won j games. 
initialize P[4,j] := 20 for j from 0 to 3 initialize P[i,4] := 0 for i from 0 to 3 
fill P in bottom-right to top left by averaging bottom and right adjacent cells: 
P[i,j] := (P[i+1,j]+P[i,j+1]) / 2 
(2) Make another 5x5 matrix, B, which represets your bet at any-time. 
So, B[i,j] represents your bet when the yanks have won i games and the Mets j games. 
fill this top-left to bottom right by: 
B[i,j] = P[i+1,j] - P[i,j] 
(3) Look in matrix B for your bet at any time. 
The final matricies are: 




Salary  aha:!
three coworkers would like to know their average salary. how can they do it, without disclosing their own salaries?
Solution: salary
How about: Person A writes a number that is her salary plus a random amount (AS + AR) and hands it to B, without showing C. B then adds his salary plus a random amount (BS + BR) and passes to C (at each step, they write on a new paper and don't show the 3rd person). C adds CS + CR and passes to A. Now A subtracts her random number (AR), passes to B. B and C each subtract their random number and pass. After C is done, he shows the result and they divide by 3. 
As has been noted already, there's no way to liar-proof the scheme. 
It's also worth noting that once they know the average, any of the three knows the sum of the other 2 salaries.
Average salary solution 
The given solution is overcomplicated, and takes two full rounds, when just one will do:The first (A) enters his salary (SA) plus/minus a random number and writes the result on a note to give to B.B adds his salary, then writes the sum on a new note and sends to C.C adds his salary and gives the final result to A who subtract the original random number, and announces the sum.The only possible problem is that if A snatch the note B is giving to C, then he will know B's salary. However, as noted in the original solution, all three will know the average of the two others' salary.Terje
Terje Mathisen Wednesday, February 02, 2005 


Here is my solution though it does involves a long approach. All three of them will choose any number of their choise and then multiply their corresponding salary with that number. Lets say the A, B and C are three persons choose p,q and r as the respective numbers and after muliplying their salary becomes p(SA), q(SB) n r(SC).Now eachone passes this multiplied salary to other two (one by one) and they multiply it with their corresponding chosen numbers. So each figure now turns to pqr(SA), pqr(SB) and pqr(SC).They can add up this figure and get the average of the 3 diving the final figure individually by their chosen numbers.

Orbs  aha:!
you have two identical crystal orbs. you need to figure out how high an orb can fall from a 100 story building before it breaks. you know nothing about the toughness of the orbs: they may be very fragile and break when dropped from the first floor, or they may be so tough that dropping them from the 100th floor doesn't even harm them. 
what is the largest number of orb-drops you would ever have to do in order to find the right floor? (i.e. what's the most efficient way you could drop the orbs to find your answer?) 
you are allowed to break both orbs, provided that in doing so you uniquely identify the correct floor. 
Solution: orbs
14. 
Drop first orb from floors 14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100... (ie move up 14 then 13, then 12 floors, etc) until it breaks (or doesn't at 100). Call the first floor at which it breaks n and the previous tested floor n'. Then try the intervening floors (n'+1 .. n'-1) with the other orb. 
Worst case is if correct floor is 13,14,26,27, etc which require m drops with the first orb and 14-m drops with the second.


Gold chain  aha:!!!
a man has a gold chain with 7 links. he needs the service of a laborer for 7 days at a fee of one gold link per day. however, each day of work needs to be paid for separately. in other words, the worker must be paid each day after working and if the laborer is ever overpaid he will quit with the extra money. also he will never allow himself to be owed a link. 
what is the fewest # of cuts to the chain to facilitate this arrangement and how does that guarantee payment?
Solution: gold chain
Can we get change back from the laborer? 
If so, we cut one link to make a chain of 4 links, a chain of 2 links and the cut link itself. 
Day 1, we give him the cut linkDay 2, we take back the cut link, give him the 2 link chainDay 3, we give him the cut linkDay 4, we take back both the cut link and the 2 link chain, give him the 4 link chainDay 5, we give him the cut linkDay 6, we take back the cut link, give him the 2 link chainDay 7, we give him the cut link



Surgeons  aha:!!
a one armed surgeon with a hand wound needs to operate on three patients. the surgeon only has two gloves. how can he operate on the three patients in turn without risking exchange of fluids? (remember he only has one arm so he only needs to wear one glove at a time.)
Solution: surgeons
problem: a one armed surgeon with a hand wound needs to operate on three patients. the surgeon only has two gloves. how can he operate on the three patients in turn without risking exchange of fluids? (remember he only has one arm so he only needs to wear one glove at a time.) 
solution: the surgeon places both gloves on his hand (1 and 2). he operates on patient A. he then takes the top glove off (#2), leaving on the bottom glove (#1) and operates on patient B. then he carefully reverses glove #2, so the clean side is on the outside, and he places it on top of glove #1 which is on his hand, and operates on patient C. 
this problem is kind of dumb because how's the surgeon going to change the gloves on his hand when he only has one hand. plus no offense, but how often do you come across a one-armed surgeon (i'm sure there are plenty of one-armed doctors, but a surgeon!?!). anyway, i had to make this problem child friendly and changing the story to the above was the only way to do it. consider for a minute what the initial problem was. the surgeon was just a guy, the patients were women, and the glove was... well, i won't insult your intelligence.



Clock  aha:!
part I: what is the angle between the minute hand and the hour hand at 3:15 on an analog clock? no, its not 0. 
part II: how often does the minute hand pass the hour hand on an analog clock?
Solution: clock
part I: what is the angle between the minute hand and the hour hand at 3:15 on an analog clock? no, its not 0. 
part II: how often does the minute hand pass the hour hand on an analog clock? 
answer: part I: 12 hours on the clock make 360 deg. so one hour is 30 deg. the hour hand will be directly on the 3 when the minute hand is at 12 (3:00). after 15 minutes or 1/4 of an hour, the hour hand will be 1/4 * 30 deg = 7.5 deg. away from the minute hand. 
part II: if you just think about it, intuitively you'll see the minute hand passes the hour hand 11 times every 12 hours, so it must pass it every 1 1/11 hours. but this doesn't make sense to me. i need to prove it. 
if x is our answer then every x hours, the minute hand and the hour hand will be right on top of each other. every hour the hour hand travels 5 units. so between every time that the minute and the hour hand meet, the hour hand will go 5*x units. every hour the minute hand travels 60 units, so it will have gone 60*x units. 
what we're trying to find is the distance traveled by the minute hand to reach the hour hand, once the minute hand has looped around once. consider its 12:00. both hands in the same position. after an hour, minute hand is on 12, hour hand on 1 (its traveled 5 units). now in the time it takes the minute hand to catch up to the hour hand it will travel a little bit further. We only need to find x where 5*x = 60*(x-1), since the real distance traveled by the minute hand, from where it started to where it ends, is 60*(x-1). the first hour just puts it back where it started, so we're only concerned with the extra part it traveled to reach the hour hand. 
5x = 60(x-1)5x = 60x - 6060 = 55x60/55 = x
there it is. the answer is 60/55 hours, or every 1 and 1/11 hours. 
i apologize that this is horribly confusing, but if you stare at it long enough it will make sense. 


Mountain man  aha:!
at 6 a.m. a man starts hiking a path up a mountain. he walks at a variable pace, resting occasionally, but never actually reversing his direction. at 6 p.m. he reaches the top. he camps out overnight. the next morning he wakes up at 6 a.m. and starts his descent down the mountain. again he walks down the path at a variable pace, resting occassionally, but always going downhill. at 6 p.m. he reaches the bottom. what is the probability that at some time during the second day, he is in the exact same spot he was in on the first day?
Solution: mountain man
problem: at 6 a.m. a man starts hiking a path up a mountain. he walks at a variable pace, resting occasionally, but never actually reversing his direction. at 6 p.m. he reaches the top. he camps out overnight. the next morning he wakes up at 6 a.m. and starts his descent down the mountain. again he walks down the path at a variable pace, resting occassionally, but always going downhill. at 6 p.m. he reaches the bottom. what is the probability that at some time during the second day, he is in the exact same spot he was in on the first day? 
answer: the probability is 100%. the easiest way to see it is, consider that on the second day when the man is going down the mountain, a ghost follows his original pace up the mountain. so even if he varies his pace as he goes down the mountain, at some point in time, he will be in the same spot as the ghost, and therefore, the same spot he was in the day before.



Treasure island  aha:!
you find an old treasure map in your grandma's attic. the map shows a cannon, a coconut tree, and a palm tree. the map states that to find the treasure you must:a. start at the cannon, walk toward the palm tree while counting your paces. when you reach the palm tree, turn 90 degrees to your left and walk the same number of paces. mark that spot on the ground with a stake.b. start at the cannon again, walk toward the coconut tree while counting your steps. when you reach the coconut tree, turn 90 degrees to your right and walk the same number of paces. mark that spot on the ground with a stake.c. find the midpoint between the two stakes and dig for the treasure. 
you set off in secrecy to the deserted island. upon reaching the shore you site the coconut tree and the palm tree, but someone has removed the cannon. without digging randomly all over the island, is it still possible to find the treasure?
Solution: treasure island

you set off in secrecy to the deserted island. upon reaching the shore you site the coconut tree and the palm tree, but someone has removed the cannon. without digging randomly all over the island, is it still possible to find the treasure? 
solution: this just takes basic geometry skills. when we get to the island all we see are the coconut and palm trees. so lets lay out our coordinate system such that the palm tree is at (0,0) and the coconut tree is at (1,0). it honestly doesn't matter how you describe the coordinate system - you could say the coconut is at (c,0) if you like, or even (0,c) or (0,1). we are just placing our own coordinate system on top of the existing surface. if you use a different system, you will get a different numerical answer but the same positional answer in the real world. 

here is our island. the cannon is at (x,y) because we have no idea where it is, so x and y are the unknowns. (note the cannon doesn't have to be in the upper right quadrant but it won't make a difference in the solution because x and y could be negative if we want them to be). 

if we walk to the palm and turn right we can easily see the way it lays out in the diagram. you basically have just transposed the x and y positions. 

it might be easier to think of it as a triangle, and flipping the triangle around to find the point for the next stake at (y, -x) 

we do the same thing with the coconut tree, although here its only a tiny bit trickier because we have to factor in the position of the coconut tree at (1,0) or (c,0). 

we use the idea of a triangle to help us better understand that the stake will end up at (1-y, x+1) or (c-y, x+c). 
then to find the midpoint of the two points which is just the first position + the second position divided by two. 
(y, -x) and (1-y, x+1)((y - y + 1)/2, (x - x + 1)/2)(1/2, 1/2)
hence our answer is (1/2,1/2) - although we'll see that if we had use the constant C for the coconut tree we would have ended up with (c/2, c/2). this is important because even though we laid out the island in our own coordinate system, its not always the case that c must be positive. i think (and i've seen this solution elsewhere, but can't really come up with a repro, so let me know if i'm wrong here) there really are two places the treasure could be because c could also be negative. so if we use our first answer of (1/2,1/2) we must also search at (-1/2, -1/2). if the cannon was in the lower half of the coordinate system you can see that the treasure would actually be in that quadrant also.


Screwy pirates  aha:!
a. first i would just like to say i am so glad jenna got voted off survivor. yuck, i couldn't stand her ever since she accused that guy of eating beef jerky when he was chewing on grass.b. recruit meyer on boot camp rocks. did you see how he made himself cry to get sympathy? and it worked! he is the funniest part of the show. i hope he wins.c. i apologize for this site being soooooo slow. but that's why you get what you pay for. (i didn't pay anything so i shouldn't really expect anything in return.)d. those screwy pirates are at it again. this time there are 13 pirates and they need to protect their treasure chest. they decide that they should only be able to open the chest if the majority (at least 7) agree that it should be opened. they ask a locksmith to come and put a specific number of locks on the safe. every lock must be opened to open the chest. there can be multiple keys for each lock, but each key only opens one lock (i.e. no skeleton keys). the locksmith can give more than one key to each pirate. how many locks should the locksmith use and what strategy should he use to distribute the keys, such that only when a majority of the pirates agree can the chest be opened?

a somewhat technical answer is here. 
(un)fortunately that user left it up to me to explain why this solution works... but fortunately my brother did it here in a very understandable fashion. thanks big brother!
Technical solution for screwy pirates
Here is solution that works for any number of pirates and any number of pirates needed to open to chest. 
Let T be the total number of pirates. Let N be the number of pirates required to open the chest. 
The number of locks needed would be L = (T,N-1) = (T!)/[(N-1)! * (T-N-1)!]. The number of keys each pirate would have be K = (T-1,N-1) = (T-1)!/[(N-1)! * (T-N)!]. 
For this specific problem, the number of locks would be 1716 and the number of keys per pirate would be 924. 
I know I haven't provided an explanation of why and how this system works. We'll leave that lengthy, involved explanation to the author. 
Note: the notation (x,y) is the combination notation; I can't use the conventional combination notation in plain text. (x,y) basically asks the question "how many ways can you pick y objects from a group of x objects?" (x,y) = (x!)/[y! * (x-y)!]
Easy solution for screwy pirates
Here's a less elegant solution. How many different combinations of 6 pirates are there? 13 choose 6 is: 13!/6!7! That's a hell of a lot of locks. But you could say, put that many locks on the chest. And for each lock, you distribute keys to all the pirates EXCEPT the selection of 6 corresponding to that lock. Then any selection of 7 pirates is guaranteed to be open all the locks. For consider the first 6 of them. There will be exactly ONE lock that those six are unable, between the 6 of them, to open. But the seventh pirate will be able to open that lock. Because keys to that lock went out to everybody except those 6. 
Also, any selection of 6 pirates is guaranteed to encounter exactly one lock that they are unable to open. (So any selection of fewer than 6 is guaranteed to encounter 1 or more locks they are unable to open...) 
So that will do the trick, and the explanation of why it would do the trick is elegant. But I don't feel that it's an elegant solution, because of there being so many locks... Anyone have something better?


Ants on a triangle  aha:!
there are three ants on a triangle, one at each corner. at a given moment in time, they all set off for a different corner at random. what is the probability that they don't collide?
Solution: ants on a triangle
Consider the triangle ABC. We assume that the ants move towards different corners along the edges of the triangle. 
Total no. of movements: 8 A->B, B->C, C->A A->B, B->A, C->A A->B, B->A, C->B A->B, B->C, C->B A->C, B->C, C->A A->C, B->A, C->A A->C, B->A, C->B A->C, B->C, C->B 
Non-colliding movements: 2 A->B, B->C, C->A A->C, B->A, C->B 
(i.e. the all ants move either in the clockwise or anti-clockwise direction at the same time) 
P(not colliding) = 2/8 = 0.25



One mile south  aha:!!
how many places are there on the earth that one could walk one mile south, then one mile east, then one mile north and end up in the same spot? to be precise, let's assume the earth is a solid smooth sphere, so oceans and mountains and other such things do not exist. you can start at any point on the sphere and walk in any direction you like. 
think you've figured it out? i'll tell you now, there is more than one. in fact, there are more than two. also be advised that walking north from the north pole (or south from the south pole) is illogical and therefore does not enter into the problem. all normal assumptions about directions will be used. 
there are no tricks involved with this question. it just forces you to really think about the problem to come up with all the solutions.
Solution: one mile south  aha:
problem: how many places are there on the earth that one could walk one mile south, then one mile east, then one mile north and end up in the same spot? to be precise, let's assume the earth is a solid smooth sphere, so oceans and mountains and other such things do not exist. you can start at any point on the sphere and walk in any direction you like. think you've figured it out? i'll tell you now, there is more than one. in fact, there are more than two. also be advised that walking north from the north pole (or south from the south pole) is illogical and therefore does not enter into the problem. all normal assumptions about directions will be used. 
there are no tricks involved with this question. it just forces you to really think about the problem to come up with all the solutions. 
solution:  well the north pole is one such place. Then somewhere near the south pole such that when you walk one mile south you are at the point on the earth where the circumference is 1. that way when you walk 1 mile east, you end up back at the same point. and of course one mile north from there puts you back where you started. here is a drawing courtesy of jy. there may or may not be such a place in the northern hemisphere where walking a mile south puts you at the 1 mile circumference point on the earth. 
i'm no geometry sphere expert, so someone will have to let me know if that is physically possible (i.e. i tend to think that if you walk n units south from any point on the northern part of a sphere, other than the north pole, it is impossible for the circumference to be n or less than n, but who knows?) 
finally there are actually an infinite number of points. if we consider the case before where we went to the point with a circumference of 1, why not go to the point with a circumference of 1/2. then when you go a mile east, you loop around twice, and end up in the same spot. this holds true for 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, ... 1/n, etc.


Cube  aha:!
this is difficult to describe in words, so read this carefully, lest there be any confusion. you have a normal six sided cube. i give you six different colors that you can paint each side of the cube with (one color to each side). how many different cubes can you make? 
different means that the cubes can not be rotated so that they look the same. this is important! if you give me two cubes and i can rotate them so that they appear identical in color, they are the same cube.
Solution: cube
Let X be the number of "different" cubes (using the same definition as in the problem). Let Y be the number of ways you can "align" a given cube in space such that one face is pointed north, one is east, one is south, one is west, one is up, and one is down. (We're on the equator.) Then the total number of possibilities is X * Y. Each of these possibilities "looks" different, because if you could take a cube painted one way, and align it a certain way to make it look the same as a differently painted cube aligned a certain way, then those would not really be different cubes. Also note that if you start with an aligned cube and paint it however you want, you will always arrive at one of those X * Y possibilities. 
How many ways can you paint a cube that is already "aligned" (as defined above)? You have six options for the north side, five options for the east side, etc. So the total number is 6! (that's six factorial, or 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1). Note that each way you do it makes the cube "look" different (in the same way the word is used above). So 6! = X * Y. 
How many ways can you align a given cube? Choose one face, and point it north; you have six options here. Now choose one to point east. There are only four sides that can point east, because the side opposite the one you chose to point north is already pointing south. There are no further options for alignment, so the total number of ways you can align the cube is 6 * 4. 
Remember, Y is defined as the number of ways you can align the cube, so Y = 6 * 4. This gives us 6! = X * 6 * 4, so X = 5 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 30.


More hat puzzles  aha:!
i buried four fishermen up to their necks in the sand on the beach at low tide for keeping their fishing spot a secret from me. i put a hat on each of their heads and told them that one of them must shout out the correct color of their own hat or they will all be drowned by the incoming tide. i give them 10 minutes to do this. fisherman A and B can only see the sand dune i erected. fisherman C can see that fisherman B has a white hat on. fisherman D can see that C has a black hat, and B has a white hat. the fisherman have been told that there are four hats, two white and two black, so they know that they must have either a white or a black hat on. who shouts out the color of their hat and how do they know? 

Solution: more hat puzzles
Fisherman C shouts out. 
Fishermen A and B are in the same situation - they have no information to help them determine their hat colour so they can't answer. C and D realise this. 
Fisherman D can see both B and C's hats. If B and C had the same colour hat then this would let D know that he must have the other colour. 
When the time is nearly up, or maybe before, C realises that D isn't going to answer because he can't. C realises that his hat must be different to B's otherwise D would have answered. C therefore concludes that he has a black hat because he can see B's white one. 


Coin on a table  aha:!!!
you die and the devil says he'll let you go to heaven if you beat him in a game. the devil sits you down at a round table. he gives himself and you a huge pile of quarters. he says "ok, we'll take turns putting quarters down, no overlapping allowed, and the quarters must rest on the table surface. the first guy who can't put a quarter down loses." the devil says he wants to go first. 
being the smart programmer you are, you realize that if the devil goes first, he may automatically win. so you convince him to let you go first, which makes your day because you know you can't lose. what is your winning strategy? 
Solution: coin on a table
Here's what I came up with: 
First, put the first quarter exactly in the center of the (perfectly circular) table. 
Next, for each quarter the opponent places, place one directly opposite it. That is, place it so that the center of the table is halfway between your piece and the opponent's previous piece. 
This will generate a completely symettric (about the center) layout of quarters on the table. This means that whenever the opponent selects a free space to place a quarter in, the space opposite is guaranteed to be free as well. Since we are always guaranteed an open space, we will never lose with this strategy (and thus win when there are finally no more spaces for the opponent to use).



Noodles  aha:!
there is a pot of N noodles. (so there are 2N ends). a person randomly grabs two ends and merges them. the person keeps doing it, until there are no more noodles, (and only loops), left in the pot. what's the average number of loops in the pot?
Solution: noodles
OK, all the answers so far just list formulae, without giving any explanation. I'll try to work it out out loud. (At this point I have no idea what the answer is.) Also, it's a math problem, so I'll assume we can ignore factors like how much the noodles stick together, how stiff they are, and so on. I'm sure I have no idea to take account of those factors. 
Call the first end he picks up Noodle i. The second end he picks up is Noodle i*. 
When he sticks the first two ends together, there are two possible outcomes: 
(a) i* is the other end of noodle i, so he has created a loop. 
(ii) i* is a different noodle from i, so he has created one long noodle out of two. 
What are the odds of (a) happening? There are (2n-1) ends left in the bowl once he picks up the end of noodle i, and only 1 of them is the other end of the same noodle. Abstracting away from all physical details, let's say the odds of getting the other end of the same noodle are 1/(2n-1). 
So the odds of (b) happening are 1-[1/(2n-1)], which is [(2n-1)-1]/(2n-1), i.e. (2n-2)/(2n-1). 
If (a) happened, now we have a bowl with one loop in it, and n-1 other unlooped noodles. We add 1 to our count of loops, and repeat the problem for n-1. 
If (b) happened, now we have a bowl with 0 loops in it, and n-1 other unlooped noodles. It's just that one of those noodles is especially long. We don't add anything to our count of loops; we just repeat the problem for n-1. 
Now, when we get down to 1 unlooped noodle left in the bowl, the odds of (a) happening are 1. 
The average # of loops will be: for each point where a loop could be formed, add 1 * the probability of a loop being formed then. 
So we can write a function: 
real average_number_of_loops (int n) {  if (n == 1) {   return 1 } else {   -- there is a 1/(2n-1) chance of getting 1 loop formed here   -- and a (2n-2)/(2n-1) chance of getting 0 loops formed here    -- and in either case we then have the same problem repeated for     -- n-1 noodles    -- so we should return ([(1/(2n-1))*1] + [(2/(2n-1))*0]) + average_number_of_loops(n-1)    -- or, simplifying...    return (1/(2n-1)) + average_number_of_loops(n-1)  }
Equivalently: 
real average_number_of_loops (int n) {  if (n == 0) {   return 0  } else {   return (1/(2n-1)) + average_number_of_loops(n-1) } 
So I guess I agree with the guy who wrote: 
> Summation for i = 1 to N of 1 / 2i - 1. Sorry I can't figure out how to > resolve. 
Except that you have to understand his "1 / 2i - 1" as being "1/ (2i - 1)." Which is no doubt what he intended. But now we have an explanation of why.


Heaven  aha:!
a person dies, and arrives at the gate to heaven. there are three doors. one of them leads to heaven. another one leads to a 1-day stay at hell, and then back to the gate, and the other leads to a 2-day stay at hell, and then back to the gate. every time the person is back at the gate, the three doors are reshuffled. how long will it take the person to reach heaven? 
this is a probability question - i.e. it is solvable and has nothing to do with religion, being sneaky, or how au dente the pasta might be ;-) 
Solution: heaven
1/3 of the time, the door to heaven will be chosen, so 1/3 of the time it will take zero days. 1/3 of the time, the 1-day door is chosen; of those, the right door will be chosen the next day, so 1/9 trips take 1 day. Similarly, 1/9 will take two days (choosing the 2-day door, then the right door). 
After that, the cases split again, and again, and again. I can't seem to make a nice infinite sum this way, so let's try again. 
Suppose the average days spent is X. 1/3 of the cases are done in zero days as before. 1/3 of the cases are 1 day plus X. 1/3 are 2 + X. So: 
X = 1/3 * 0 + 1/3 * (1 + X) + 1/3 * (2 + X)  = 0 + 1/3 + X/3 + 2/3 + X/3  = 1 + 2X/3
Therefore, 
  X/3 = 1    X = 3
On average, it takes three days to get to heaven. Two if the noodles are limp. 
Took me one blind alley, and about five minutes. (heh heh)


Flipping coins
someone walks into your room and dumps a huge bag of quarters all over the floor. they spread them out so no quarters are on top of any other quarters. a robot then comes into the room and is programmed such that if it sees a head, it flips it to tails. if it sees a tail, it throws it in the air. the robot moves around randomly forever. will there be a convergence in distribution of heads vs. tails? 
Solution: flipping coins
Hmmm. I made a little math trick out of it. If the 'bot finds a head, it flips. If the bot finds a tail, there's a fifty percent chance this will become a head, as well. 
(P_h = #heads/#coins, P_t = #tails/#coins) 
So, delta h = -P_h + .5 P_t 
= -(1 - P_t) + .5 P_t 
= 1.5 P_t -1 
Which is zero when P_t is 2/3. It's important to remember that a flip to a tail results in no change to the number of tails -- this threw me off for a second.


Pennies  aha:!!
i challenge you to a game. we each get one penny and we flip them at the same time. (so on turn 1, we each flip our respective pennies - turn 2, we flip them again, and so on until someone wins). i am looking to get heads then tails. you are looking to get heads then heads. so if you flip heads on any flip and then heads on the next flip, you win. if i flip heads on any flip and then tails on the next flip, i win. (its not a speed race, we both flip at the same time, except i'm only concerned with what appears on my coin, and you are only concerned with whats on your coin). are the odds fair? (obviously not, otherwise this wouldn't be a question). who has the advantage and why? 
Solution: pennies
(ummm,, I don't right too good. ;) ) 
In a 3 turn game: 
O needs HH, X needs HT 
HHH O 
HHT OX 
HTH X 
HTT X 
THH O 
THT X 
TTH 
TTT 
X wins 4 times out of 8, O wins 3 times out of 8 
Its because in the event X loses there is a 50% chance of starting out on another H where O has to start on a T 75% of the time. (or something like that...) 


Linked list  aha:!!
how does one find a loop in a singly linked list in O(n) time using constant memory? you cannot modify the list in any way (and constant memory means the amount of memory required for the solution cannot be a function of n.)
Solution: linked list
I first figured this out when I was asked the question in a Microsoft interview, so there's verification that one question in the book was from a real interview. The best part of this problem is that I actually needed to write the code out for it a little while ago to detect a bug. 
One way to detect a loop is to iterate over the list with 2 pointers at the same time where one is iterating at double speed. If the 2 pointers are ever equal after they iterate once and before they both reach an end, there's a loop. 
Now for another puzzle.. I think the next question I had to answer was something along the lines of "OK, How do you remove a loop in a linked list with the same constraints?" The latter question definitely seems harder, but in the sequence of questions I'd already answered for the interviewer, the solution was pretty obvious. I'll leave that solution to someone else today. 
Hm. I think I should pick up that book. I've always wondered where people got their juicy interview riddles.. I've always just repeated ones I've heard before or made up new ones along the same lines.



Last ball  aha:!
you have 20 blue balls and 14 red balls in a bag. you put your hand in and remove 2 at a time. if they're of the same color, you add a blue ball to the bag. if they're of different colors, you add a red ball to the bag. (assume you have a big supply of blue & red balls for this purpose. note: when you take the two balls out, you don't put them back in, so the number of balls in the bag keeps decreasing). what will be the color of the last ball left in the bag? 
once you tackle that, what if there are 20 blue balls and 13 red balls to start with? 
Solution: last ball
You always take off Red Balls two by two ! 
So if you start with 14 Red Balls, you cannot have one single Red ball at the end. 
... so the last ball is blue. 
But if you start with 13 Red Balls, as you take them off 2 by 2 (at one moment or the other you'll do it !) you will arrive at a moment when you have 1 red ball in the bag. But as you can only take off Red Balls 2 by 2 (Did I already say that ?!) you'll remove the last Blue Balls, one by one...... 
So the lastball will be red... 
Oh, by the way, did I tell you that you take off Red Balls 2 by 2 ?! ;-> 
For tired people here is why you take off Red Balls 2 by 2 :- If you take off 1 RED and 1 BLUE, in fact you will take off 1 BLUE - If you take off 2 RED, in fact you will take off 2 RED (and add 1 BLUE) - If you take off 2 BLUE, in fact you will take off 1 BLUE


Coin rolls  aha:!
every night, i dump all the change in my pocket into a big bucket. 
when I buy things, i never hand over coins. always bills. so i accumulate a lot of coins. even if the purchase price is $1.01, and i have lots of coins in my pocket, i pay $2 and take the 99c in change. all the more coins to dump in my change bucket! 
after about 10 years of this, i decide to roll all the coins into rolls. remember that a quarter roll is $10, a dime roll is $5, nickels $2, pennies 50 cents. so I go to the Banking Supply Store and buy empty paper rolls. 
the Banking supply store, conveniently, sells assortment packs of coin rolls. each assortment pack contains W quarter rolls, X dime rolls, Y nickel rolls, and Z penny rolls. 
the question: what is the optimum ratio of W to X to Y to Z to maximize the probability that I will use up the assortment packs at the same rate, e.g. without lots of leftover nickel tubes and stuff. 
p.s. this problem should ideally be solved using Excel (but if you really like doing these things by hand, be my guest). 

paul brinkley makes these assumptions which are all good assumptions to make:Assumption 1: The price of purchases made, modulo $1, is an even distribution from 0 cents to 99 cents.Assumption 2: The cashier will always give you the least number of coins mathematically possible, and will always have enough of each type of coin to do this. So you'll never get 99 pennies as change for a $1.01 purchase, for example.Assumption 3: Half dollars don't exist. 
solution: coin rolls
"Brute force" approach: 
I guess I'll begin with a few assumptions: 
Assumption 1: The price of purchases made, modulo $1, is an even distribution from 0 cents to 99 cents. Probably not true, but we can cover that later. 
Assumption 2: The cashier will always give you the least number of coins mathematically possible, and will always have enough of each type of coin to do this. So you'll never get 99 pennies as change for a $1.01 purchase, for example. 
Assumption 3: Half dollars don't exist. 
Over the long haul, then, you'd get N sets of 0 cents, 1 cent, 2 cents, and so on up to 99 cents. So let's consider one of each. How many of each coin would you end up with? 
Easy first: let's do quarters. 25-49 cents each gets you one. 50-74 each gets you two. 75-99 each gets you three. That's (1+2+3)*25, or 150 quarters. 
Dimes next. 10-19 gets you one. 20-24, two. (You'd get a quarter instead for 25 and up.) 35-44, one. 45-49, two. 60-69, 85-94, one. 70-74, 95-99, two. So that's 4*(10+5*2), or 80 dimes. 
Nickels. One for 5-9, 15-19, and that same pattern for +25, +50, +75, so it's 4*10 or 40 nickels. You'll never get two at a time, since a dime (at least) will do. 
Pennies. Let's cut to the chase: 1,2,3, and 4 cents gets 10 pennies in all, and that pattern happens 20 times, so that's 200 pennies. 
Let's double-check. 200 pennies, 40 nickels, 80 dimes, 150 quarters. That's 200*1 + 40*5 + 80*10 + 150*25 cents = 200+200+800+3750 = 4950 cents, which is the sum of all numbers from 0 to 99, so it checks. 
15/8/4/20 would be the ratio then, IF coin rolls all hold the same number of coins, but they don't. Quarter rolls hold 40 coins, dime rolls hold 50, nickel rolls 40, penny rolls 50. So you need 5/4 as many quarter and nickel rolls. The final ratio is 75/32/20/80. Seems like a lot of quarters and pennies, except for the assumption that you'll tend to get them much more often than nickels and dimes as change. 
The numbers change slightly when you figure in things like frequency of coins in circulation, the supply the cashier has at any one time, the actual distribution of change values, and the cashier's inclination to give you two dimes and a nickel instead of a quarter just because... 
So what numbers do assortment packs really contain?


Calendar cubes  aha:!!!!
a man has two cubes on his desk. every day he arranges both cubes so that the front faces show the current day of the month. what numbers are on the faces of the cubes to allow this? 
Solution: calendar cubes
Hmm. I don't know why this would warrant four aha's, but we'll see... 
First, to show all possible days, we'd need one of each of the ten digits. We'd also need two 1s and two 2s to show 11 and 22. That's twelve numbers right there. Two cubes, twelve faces, so every face is used. Quite elegant. 
We know each cube will need a 1 and a 2. Let's put the 3 on one of them. The 0 has to go on the other. We put 4, 5, and 6 on the 3-cube since we need to show 04 05 06. 
But now where do 7, 8, and 9 go? The 0-cube needs them to be on the 3-cube, but it's full. I'm beginning to see why this gets four aha's. 
Let's try this: clear both cubes, put the 0 on one of them. Now 1-9 have to go on the other cube to show 01-09. We can't put a 0 on the other cube, too, because that puts us over the 12-digit limit. It seems I have mathematical proof that this cannot be done! What am I missing? It's not like you can turn one of the other numbers sidewise to make another 0... 
Heh. 
You CAN make a 9 out of a 6, though. That frees up a digit. So you put 0, 1, and 2 on both cubes. Put 3 on one of them. 4 and 5 can go on it too. Put 6, 7, and 8 on the other. Now you can show 01-31 with no problem, and even 00 and 32 if you're feeling weird. 
I'd've given it two, maybe three aha's. :) 


Boys and girls  aha:!
in a country in which people only want boys, every family continues to have children until they have a boy. if they have a girl, they have another child. if they have a boy, they stop. what is the proportion of boys to girls in the country? 
Solution: boys and girls
Pretty simple. Half the couples have boys first, and stop. The rest have a girl. Of those, half have a boy second, and so on. 
So suppose there are N couples. There will be N boys. There will be an "infinite" sum of girls equal to N/2 + N/4 + N/8 + ... As any college math student knows, this sum adds up to N. Therefore, the proportion of boys to girls will be pretty close to 1:1, with perhaps a few more boys than girls because the sum isn't actually infinite. 
Btw, hope you enjoyed your fishing trip, Michael! 


Painfully easy  aha:!
i flip a penny and a dime and hide the result from you. "one of the coins came up heads", i announce. what is the chance that the other coin also came up heads? 
Solution: painfully easy
Assuming complete honesty on the part of the flipper, wouldn't the solution be 33%?
There are four possible scenarios:
HHTHHTTT
Obviously the TT possibility can be discounted because it does not result in one of the two being heads.
This lees us with three possibilities, only one of which has the other coin also being heads. 
Therefore one third.
I think.
I usually get these wrong.


Chinese emperor  aha:!
A chinese emperor had to choose a new adviser amongst 3 sages, all of them equally wise. He placed a problem to them: "To choose one of you, you'll play a simple and fair game: In this sack there are 3 white balls and 2 black balls. Each of you will be blindfolded and will pick one ball and place it on your head. After that, the blindfolds will be removed and each one in turn will try to guess the colour of the ball upon his head, by observation of the other picked balls. However, beware. You may pass your turn in guessing, but if you state a colour and fail, you're disqualified. This way I'll learn which one is the most intelligent amongst you" The sages talked briefly to each other and promptly refused: "Dear lord, it's of no use, since the game is not fair. The last one of us to guess in the first round will know the answer." and the sages promptly demonstrated this to the emperor, who was so amazed by their wits that he appointed all 3 has his advisers. Could you demonstrated it ? NOTE: If the emperor had any wits at all he would have named them all advisers in the first place... maybe spending reduction ? :)


Nuggets  aha:!
you can go to a fast food restaurant to buy chicken nuggets in 6-pack, 9-pack or 20-packs. is there such a number N, such that for all numbers bigger than or equal to N, you can buy that number of chicken nuggets?
Solution: nuggest
Here's another way of looking at it: 
 1  2  3 4  5  6 7  8  910 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23 2425 26 2728 29 3031 32 3334 35 3637 38 3940 41 4243 44 45(and so on, to infinity)
You can get any number in the right column except 3 by adding 6s and 9s. So cross out the entire right column except 3. You can also add 20 to any crossed-out number and cross that number out. So cross out everything in column two below and including 26. Finally, by the same logic you can add 20 to the crossed-out numbers in column 2 and thereby cross out everything in column one below and including 46. 
The largest number that's left over is 43. Incidentally, cross out 20 and 40 and your map is complete.
