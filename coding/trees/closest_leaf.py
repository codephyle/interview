Given the root of a binary tree where every node has a unique value and 
a target integer k, return the value of the nearest leaf node to the target k in the tree.
Nearest to a leaf means the least number of edges traveled on the binary tree to reach 
any leaf of the tree. Also, a node is called a leaf if it has no children.
