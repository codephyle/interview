FIND PEAK ELEMENT

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 
             where the peak element is 2,  or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
