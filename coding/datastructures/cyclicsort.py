"""
CYCLIC SORT 

We are given an array containing n objects. Each object, when created, 
was assigned a unique number from the range 1 to n based on their creation sequence. 
This means that the object with sequence number 3 was created just before the object with sequence number 4.

Write a function to sort the objects in-place on their creation sequence number in  O(n) and 
without using any extra space. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume we are passed an integer array 
containing only the sequence numbers, though each number is actually an object.


Input: [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Example 2:

Input: [2, 6, 4, 3, 1, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Example 3:

Input: [1, 5, 6, 4, 3, 2]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

"""
FIND ALL MISSING NUMBERS 

We are given an unsorted array containing numbers taken from the range 1 to 'n'.
The array can have duplicates, which means some numbers will be missing. Find all those missing numbers.

Input: [2, 3, 1, 8, 2, 3, 5, 1]
Output: 4, 6, 7
Explanation: The array should have all numbers from 1 to 8, due to duplicates 4, 6, and 7 are missing.
