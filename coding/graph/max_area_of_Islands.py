# MAX AREA OF AN ISLAND

# You are given an 'm x n' binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

# The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island. Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
